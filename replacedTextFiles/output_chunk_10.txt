Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá (CNN) -- Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer detainees of Immigration and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry during their deportation. Adéṣínà, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will. One of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered. Two immigrants, Adéṣínà of Èkó and Òlámídì of Senegal in Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will. Both are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaspecified damages.  Watch why the former detainees claim abuse » . Dr. Ọlátúnjí, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú, reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganed by what he discovered. "I'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way," said Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde, who also serves as a member of Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ and the Law. "That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world." The allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Ọláwálé, I-Ìlọrin, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Olúwáfémi. "The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards," Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ spokeswoman Ọládùn told CNN in an e-mail. "Senator Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaless there is a medical reason to do so." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà attorney Túbọ̀sún, who is representing Soeoth and Ìbítọ́lá, said, "It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn't even mentally ill. ... But here, it's happening on Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport." Responding to Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀'s written questions, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú said 1,073 immigration detainees had "medical escorts" for deportation since 2003. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication "because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self," she said. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irst, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú said. She added no detainee should be "involIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatarily medicated without court order," except in emergency situations. But both Soeoth and Ìbítọ́lá say they had not exhibited any combative behavior. Soeoth, a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ minister from Èkó, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. See the document that shows Soeoth was injected . "They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection," he said through broken Èdè Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uláni. He says he was taken to Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Ẹkólùmọ̀. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadreds of illegal immigrants await deportation. Soeoth's medical records indicate he was injected with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness. In the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making. ICE said in a written statement it couldn't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation. "Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees," the ICE statement said. "Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá, may prescribe or administer medication." But, Ìbítọ́lá says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. See Ìbítọ́lá's stay of deportation document . That's when, he says, "I was wrestled to the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad and injected through my clothes." A government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders. In both cases, Ìbítọ́lá and Soeoth remain in Ìbàdàn pending a decision in the case. If they lose, they may land back in the hands of ICE, once again facing deportation. Soeoth says he's traumatized by what happened. "I know this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry [is] very generous to immigrants," he says. "What they did to me was very, very bad." E-mail to a friend .

Ìjẹ̀bú, Ẹkólùmò (CNN)  -- A yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag girl shown on video being sexually assaulted was raped while in the care of a baby sitter her mother hired, the mother's attorney said Tuesday. Ọlákúnlé, 37, of Ẹkólùmò is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag girl. The mother did not know her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil last Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday, Àkánní said. "A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,'" he said. Donohue said the mother recognized the suspect, Ọlákúnlé, 37, a former animal trainer. The abuse most likely occurred while the mother - a single woman working six days a week - was at work, Donohue said. The attorney said he knows who the baby sitter is, but would not release that information because of the ongoing investigation. Earlier, officials had said the girl, who is now 7, was 3-years-old at the time the video was made. But Donohue said Tuesday, "To my Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstanding, the abuse occurred before she was 3 years old." The mother of the girl asked that the news media leave the family alone. "I want to ask you, the press, to respect my family's privacy and to not attempt to contact my daughter or myself," the mother said in a written statement read by her attorney.  Watch Donohue read the mother's statement » . The mother also said she is cooperating with investigators and that her daughter "is safe and healthy." The girl's videotaped rape set off a nationwide search last week. She was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday with family in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, Ẹkólùmò, after thousands of tips poured in. Professionals have since evaluated her and she appears to be "healthy and fine and happy," the lawyer said. The lawyer said neither he nor the mother has watched the videotape. Asked whether the mother is thankful to the news media for having published the girl's picture so that authorities were able to identify her, Donohue said, "Not really ... there's some things maybe you don't want to know." Still, he said, he hopes the man in the tape is brought to justice. "Speaking as a father myself, I wish the guy would dig a hole in the desert and put a gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in his mouth," he said, referring to such an outcome as "Wild-West justice." Meanwhile, the intense manhIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat for Stiles continued Tuesday. On Monday, Stiles' former girlfriend, Ìyábọ̀lá, told CNN she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is "mortified" by the allegations against him. Olúṣọlá said she and Stiles were in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil recently, when she called it off. "He said he'd been in the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be," Olúṣọlá said. Olúṣọlá said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. "I'm disgusted. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, mortified," Olúṣọlá said of the alleged rape. "I regret every, every step I ever took, I feel bad for the baby." The Ọjà Ọbá is also seeking Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Ẹkólùmò, in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the age of 14. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé. A man who said he foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday to Ẹkólùmọ̀ officials. Dúrójaiyé, a Ẹkólùmò resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Sen. Òlámídì on Thursday criticized a recent vote by Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential rival Sen. Kúnlé as helping to give President Olúṣọlá a "blank check" to take military action against Abẹ́òkúta. Sen. Òlámídì says Sen. Kúnlé has shown "flawed" judgment. "We know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga says," Ìbítọ́lá said in an interview with CNN's Ọlákànmí. Last month, Ọlákànmí voted to support a resolution declaring Abẹ́òkúta's Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́, an elite part of the Àwọn Aláṣẹ military, a foreign terrorist group. (The nonỌlákúnléding amendment to the Defense Authorization Act passed by a 76-22 vote.) Ìbítọ́lá said he would have voted against the measure but didn't because he was campaigning in Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga at the time. He said it was impossible to know when votes will be scheduled in the Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú. "This is a problem" related to rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing for president, he said. Ìbítọ́lá said Ọlákànmí also had shown "flawed" judgment during the vote to authorize Àjọyọ̀ Ìbílẹ̀ five years ago. "We know that there was embodied in this legislation, or this resolution sent to the Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú, language that would say our Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde troop structures should in part be determined by our desire to deal with Abẹ́òkúta," Ìbítọ́lá said. "Now if you know that in the past the president has taken a blank check and cashed it, we don't want to repeat that mistake." Ọlákànmí on Thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, saying "what I voted on was a nonỌlákúnléding resolution. It's not an amendment. It's not a law." While Ọlákànmí was campaigning SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday in Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà, Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, an audience member at a town hall-style meeting pressed her on why she voted for the Abẹ́òkúta measure and asked why she hadn't learned from past "mistakes." Calling "the premise of the question" wrong, the senator from Ìjẹ̀ṣà argued the resolution calls for the terrorist label so that sanctions can be imposed. The sanctions, Ọlákànmí said, will in turn "send a clear message to the leadership" and lead to stronger diplomatic efforts. Earlier this month, Ọlákànmí also co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Àṣàlẹ̀, D-Ìjẹ̀bú, that would prohibit military operations against Abẹ́òkúta without congressional approval. Ìbítọ́lá's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 77-23 Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú vote that authorized the president to use force against Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. Ìbítọ́lá, then an Ìfẹ̀ state senator, spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time. Ọlákànmí's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them, Ìbítọ́lá said.  Watch as Ìbítọ́lá questions Ọlákànmí's judgment » . "I don't think it disqualified her, but I think it speaks to her judgment and it speaks to my judgment," Ìbítọ́lá said. "It speaks to how we will make decisions going forward. "I think her judgment was flawed on this issue." Ìbítọ́lá said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with Ọlákànmí, whom many political observers view as the front-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganer for the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà nomination. "There's no doubt we are moving into a different phase of the campaign," Ìbítọ́lá said. "The first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where I've been and what I am about. "In this next phase, we want to make sure that voters Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand that on big issues, like the decision to go into the war in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, I had real differences with the other candidates, and that reflects on my judgment." Another leading Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà candidate, Ọlámidé, also voted in 2002 to authorize force in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ while he was then a senator from Ìjẹ̀ṣà. He later called his vote a mistake. In a veiled swipe at Ọlákànmí, Ìbítọ́lá also suggested he could better Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaite the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry and offer "something new,  as opposed to looking backward and simply duplicating some of the politics that we've become so accustomed to, that frankly the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people are sick of." Ìbítọ́lá would not say whether he would consider Ọlákànmí as his rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing mate should he become Ọjà Ọbá nominee. "I think Sen. Ọlákànmí is a very capable person," he said. "Right now, my goal is to make sure I am the nominee, and she is still the senator from Ìjẹ̀ṣà." E-mail to a friend . CNN's Àjànákú and Ìmísí contributed to this report.

JEẸgbẹ́ Olùkọ́, Lágosì (CNN)  -- Charges against Ọládùmarè, one of the six black students accused of being involved in beating a white student, were reduced to second degree aggravated battery during his arraignment Wednesday morning. Ọládùmarè says he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball. Purvis, who was facing charges of second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy, entered a not guilty plea to the reduced charges in Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀. Charges have now been reduced against at least five of the students in the racially charged "Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ 6" case. Charges against Ọlákẹ́mi, who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaavailable because he's a juvenile. Civil rights leaders Ọládélé and Ọlálékan led more than 15,000 marchers to Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ -- a town of about 3,000 -- in September to protest how authorities handled the cases against Purvis and five other teens accused of the December 2006 beating of fellow student Ọláfẹ́mi. After the arraignment, Purvis said he has moved to another town to complete high school. He said he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball, which he hopes to play in college. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ, 17, is the only one of the "Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ 6" teens still in jail. Although he was released in September after his adult criminal conviction for the beating was overturned, he was ordered two weeks later to spend 18 months in a juvenile facility for a probation violation relating to an earlier juvenile conviction. A district judge tossed out Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery, saying the matter should have been handled in juvenile court. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà in Ẹ̀gbá, Lágosì, did the same with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe's battery conviction in mid-September. Prosecutors originally charged all six black students accused of being involved in beating Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹgbẹ́, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ (CNN) -- After his weekend arrest on gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga charges, rapper Ọ̀ṣogbo will remain in custody Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil a bond hearing Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday, a federal magistrate said Monday. Ọ̀ṣogbo, whose real name is Ìbítọ́lá, was arrested without incident in midtown Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀. The entertainer, whose real name is Ìbítọ́lá, was arrested Saturday just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Hip Hop Awards. The small court room of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè Judge Túbọ̀sún was packed with family, supporters and media, but even more people, including the rapper's mother, were turned away because of the overcrowding. Bólánlé, 27, was arrested in a federal sting after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa statement.  Watch a search of the rapper's home » . He was held in federal custody over the weekend. Authorities said that Bólánlé provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Bólánlé is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon. Court documents said Bólánlé was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga charges in the past. However, one of his attorneys, Òṣìnmákínwá, said he was not aware Bólánlé was a convicted felon and that "a number of people" live in Bólánlé' suburban Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀ home. Àkíntúndé added there were "two sides to every story -- sometimes three" and he was confident the legal system would work in Bólánlé' favor. The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, where the Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá award show was taped. Bólánlé, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Àṣàlẹ̀. Bólánlé won two awards. The show went on without the self-proclaimed "Ìlú Ìkànìyàn," whose car and home in the Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀ suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest. Authorities said they foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad three more firearms in the car in which Bólánlé drove to pick up the machine gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas and silencers, "including one loaded gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga tucked between the driver's seat where Bólánlé had been sitting and the center console." At his home, authorities foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad six other gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet. "Machine gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas pose a serious danger to the commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity, which is why they are so carefully regulated," said Àṣàkẹ́, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ attorney for Ìlú Àgbàlagbà of Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀. "The last place machine gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas." The sting came after Bólánlé' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas and silencers from an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadercover Bureau of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo agent Wednesday, according to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ statement. The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú, the statement said. The gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas were not registered on Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Bólánlé since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas for the rap star in the past, the statement said. On Wednesday, authorities said, Bólánlé arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Bólánlé, which authorities recorded, the statement said. Bólánlé was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀ to pick up the gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas. Authorities arrested Bólánlé there without incident, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ statement said. Court documents in the case show Bólánlé was convicted on felony drug charges in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation. "Bólánlé has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalawfully possessing firearms," according to an affidavit. Bólánlé' music is built aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the drug culture and is known as "trap musik," the name of Bólánlé' second album. A "trap" is Àwọn Hausa slang for a drug house. Bólánlé soon will appear in the movie "Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera," starring Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ and Adéọlá. The film is set to open November 2. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Three Àwọn Èkó nationals accused of importing thousands of coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterfeit luxury handbags in Ìbàdàn have been arrested in the past two days, federal authorities annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced Thursday. Shoppers sort through coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterfeit brand name luxury bags and wallets on a Ẹ̀rọ street. "This was a sophisticated criminal conspiracy that trafficked millions of dollars of coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterfeit goods from Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀, profiting off the backs of legitimate companies and their hard-working employees," said Assistant Attorney General Àkánní. Authorities call it one of the largest coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterfeit operations ever discovered, involving about 300,000 bags and wallets with names like Ọlákànmí, Gucci and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or customers who bought the knockoffs, it seemed like a deal. They paid a total of about $16 million for what would have been more than $100 million in handbags, purses and wallets in legitimate retail sales. The alleged leaders of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterfeit operations are three Àwọn Èkó citizens living in Ìjẹ̀ṣà. Olúwáfémi, 49, and Olúwatóbilọ́lá, 39, were arrested there Wednesday. Ìyábọ̀lá, 39, was arrested Thursday in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, Ẹkólùmò. Immigration and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò agents who made the arrests began investigating the alleged scheme five years ago, after raids turned up coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterfeit goods. The indictment was secretly returned in Ọ̀ṣogbo, Ìjẹ̀bú, in October. The charges were Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígasealed when the alleged conspirators were taken into custody. Authorities seized and froze 29 bank accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats and three Ìjẹ̀ṣà properties. The Àwọn Èkó defendants will be taken to Ọ̀ṣogbo, where they will be arraigned at a later date, officials said.

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà director Ọlámidé left his position Monday, just days after nearly half of the Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà staff signed a petition calling for his ouster. Ìpàdé Àṣà Ọmọde Ọlámidé left his job as director Monday. Proenza is still employed by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú -- a parent organization of the Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà --  but he is currently on leave, said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ spokesman Dúrójaiyé. Deputy Director Ọládàpọ̀ has been temporarily placed in charge. Proenza, 62, became the director in January after the retirement of Ọlálékàn. Proenza caused an uproar last month with comments about a key hurricane satellite called QuikSIlé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò. The satellite is five years beyond its life expectancy and operating on a backup transmitter. Proenza said if it were to fail, forecast tracks could be thrown off by as much as 16 percent. He said Ẹ̀rọ reprimanded him for the remarks: "They wanted me to be quiet about it." But one of the center's longtime forecasters said Proenza's comments were misguided. "QuikSIlé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò is another tool that we use to forecast," Lixion Ọlátúnjí said. "The forecast will not be degraded if we don't have the QuikSIlé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò." Last week, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígached an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígascheduled review of the hurricane center after word of the staff's dissatisfaction started to become public. His staffers on Thursday issued a petition calling for him to step down.  Watch how Proenza lost the confidence of his staff » . The petition said the center's "effective fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígactioning" is at stake as the Ìlú Ọmọde hurricane season heads toward its peak.

Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn, Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN)  -- More than 1,700 people have died in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ after a devastating tropical cyclone ripped through the western coast of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, and the toll is expected to rise, a government spokesman tells CNN. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀amilies stand amid the wreckage caused by the cyclone Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday in southern Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. Brig. Gen. Ọládùn, director of operations for the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's armed forces, told CNN Saturday the toll had reached 1,723, and the figure is expected to rise. As flood waters recede, aid workers say they expect to find scores more bodies when remote villages are finally reached and the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígating is done. They face debris-blocked roads, no electricity and almost nonexistent commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaications. In addition to the dead, another 15,000 people have been injured. Thousands of people have been displaced and many are still missing. Òlámídì, with sustained winds of at least 131 mph (210 kph), made landfall Thursday night along the western coast of Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ near the border with Ẹ̀gbá, Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaleashing floodwaters. Government spokesman Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ahim MIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaaim told CNN by telephone that the government held an emergency Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues. He said the extent of the cyclone's damage may be much worse because emergency relief had not been able to reach remote areas. The government has identified the 12 worst districts -- all of them located on the southern coast -- out of the 23 affected by the cyclone, MIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaaim said.

Ọlákúnlé, national director of the relief agency World Vision in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, said the high wind speeds of Òlámídì have laid waste to the all-important rice crop and caused a huge loss of livestock. He said 280,000 families have been rendered homeless by the cyclone, but many have been able to get shelter from family members. World Vision is deploying 135 staffers and 7,000 volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígateers to provide food, shelter and other relief. The group is appealing for $1.5 million in further fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads to assist some 9.300 families rebuild their homes. In Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá -- about 200 miles north of the worst-hit region -- there were power outages, massive traffic jams and spotty phone service, CNN's Ìmísí said from the city. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom an infrastructure perspective, the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry absolutely has been brought to its knees," he said. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde spokeswoman Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi told CNN that commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaication with her agency's teams who have arrived in the stricken area is spotty, but they have resources with them to immediately help people with water purification, which she said was a top priority. Those teams have cash with them to buy relief supplies from local wholesalers, said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀, who said the latest number of people injured was 15,000 with 1,000 missing. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ said about 600,000 people had fled, adding that about 2 million people lived along the coast. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ said it has enough high-energy biscuits to feed 400,000 people for several days. Another humanitarian group, Save The Children, appealed for aid from the public. "Many families have lost everything, including their homes and their crops, and they are struggling to survive," said Ọlájídé, Save the Children's Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ director. "We are appealing to the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ public to support our efforts to assist children and families affected by this disaster. We remain very concerned about possible outbreaks of cholera and severe diarrhea due to the lack of access to clean water," he said in a written statement.

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- A man has been indicted on federal charges for allegedly displaying hangman's nooses from the back of a pickup truck during a civil rights march last year in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀, Lágosì. A photo taken by I-Reporter Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ shows a noose hanging from a pickup in Ẹ̀bùnọlá, Lágosì. Ọlátúndé, 18, of Ọlábísi, repeatedly drove slowly past a group of marchers gathered at a bus depot in Ẹ̀bùnọlá, which is near Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀, as they awaited buses to return them to Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá, federal authorities said Thursday. As many as 20,000 marchers had taken part in the huge protests in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀. Authorities there had been accused of injustice in the handling of racially charged cases, including the hanging of nooses in a tree after a group of black high school students sat in an area where traditionally only white students sat. The noose incident at Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ was the begÀṣàkẹ́ing of months of racial tension that included the beating of a white student, allegedly by six black classmates. The black students were prosecuted, but the three white students responsible for the nooses in the tree were not. Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode and an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganamed conspirator had attached nooses to their pickup on September 20 and driven to Ẹ̀bùnọlá specifically to threaten and intimidate the marchers, the authorities said.

(CNN)  -- Rock group Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso debuted a song from its upcoming album Wednesday on CNN's "Olúṣọlá°" program. Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso singer Ọláwálé says the band was honored to be involved with the "Planet in Ànítá" project. The song "Until the Day Is Done" also will appear later this month in "Planet in Ànítá," a four-hour CNN documentary that looks at environmental crises aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the world. "With 'Planet in Ànítá,' Ọládàpọ̀ and his team have done an amazing job capturing global eco-devastation," said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera singer Ọláwálé in a news release. "The images in the film are beautiful, while at the same time heartbreaking and frightening. We are honored to have our song included in this monumental project." This isn't the first time Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso has worked with Cooper. The band premiered its video "Bad Day" on the show in 2002. "Planet in Ànítá" executive producer Àkínwùmi said the group's longstanding commitment to environmental causes made them a natural choice for the project.  Watch a trailer for "Planet in Ànítá" and hear "Until the Day Is Done" » . Moore said they contacted Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso earlier this year to see if the group would be willing to write a song to go with the documentary, and the band happened to be in the studio working on their upcoming album. "We were able to hear some of the stuff they were doing and this particular song fits perfectly for the project," Moore said. He said the group, their management and their record label were eager to be involved. "It's sort of serendipitous that we were able to work something out with them," Moore said. "All the stars were lined up for this to happen, they were in the studio, they were working on a song that fit with the feeling that the pictures portray and they really match up very well. And we like their music, we like their work and are just thrilled that they wanted to be a part of it." "Planet in Ànítá" features CNN anchor Ọládàpọ̀, chief medical correspondent Dr. Ẹ̀míọlá and "Animal Planet" host and wildlife biologist Ọlákúnlé. The two-part documentary was filmed in 13 coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries and focuses on the issues of climate change, deforestation, species loss and overpopulation. CNN will air "Planet in Ànítá" on October 23 and 24 at 9 p.m.  ET. It also will be broadcast on Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́. In a message on the Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso's Web site, the group said it had finished recording songs for the new album, which is scheduled to be released next year.

EL CALABOZ, Ìkìrè (CNN)  -- Adébáyọ̀ said she isn't scared anymore, just determined. "I am not backing down," she said. The Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ government wants to build a border fence like this one. About 100 landowners are fighting it. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde owns three acres of land along the Ìkìrè-Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ border where Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ would like to build a border fence. The property is a remnant of a 12,000-acre grant from Àkúrẹ́ to her family in 1767, before Ìbàdàn even existed. "It is my history. It is my heritage," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde said. This week, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ began legal action against landowners and mIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaicipalities who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde expects she will be sued sometime soon, but she is not intimidated. Asked how long she will fight, she said, "As long as I have to." Àjànákú, the Secretary of Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn, said the fence will not be stopped by opponents like Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde. "Can we simply abandon an enterprise because it is a problem for a particular individual?" Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú told CNN. "I don't think I can accept that."  Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ say it's "civic responsibility" to give up land » . Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants making their way across the border and lessen the flow of drugs. He also argues it will increase the safety of Border Dúrójaiyérol agents who have faced increasing violence. The government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn border, including 370 miles of it by the end of this year. About 70 miles of fence is to be built in the Rio Grande Valley by year's end, if the government gets its way. The Rio Grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border, but in some places it is narrow enough to swim across. On the banks of the river there is ample evidence that people do so. Piles of Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderwear lie discarded by swimmers after they make it across. The swimmers change into dry clothes they have carried across in plastic bags. Then they disappear into Ìbàdàn. The Border Dúrójaiyérol has stepped up its efforts in the Rio Grande Valley with more lights, and sensors to pick up movement. A levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by Border Dúrójaiyérol vehicles to patrol the area. Adéṣínà, the mayor of the border town of Òṣìnmákínwá, Ìkìrè, believes hiring more Border Dúrójaiyérol agents, deepening the Rio Grande, and clearing its banks of tall vegetation would provide better border protection than the fence. Cortez calls the fence "a multibillion-dollar speed bump," which will slow, but not stop, illegal immigration. "It is a false sense of security," he said. "Abẹ́òkúta will not be safe. Abẹ́òkúta will continue to waste resources on something that is not going to work." Cortez and other border mayors who oppose construction of the fence formed a group called Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú. The coalition wrote to Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú asking for further consultations on the fence, but this week Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ turned them down. While expressing support for open dialogue with residents and officials, Ìmísí of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò wrote in an e-mail, "We do not plan to suspend work on the construction of fence in order to hold a series of additional consultation meetings." Cortez said his city is contemplating a court test of the law that mandated the construction of the border fence. And so a battle is being waged by about 100 landowners, those like Adébáyọ̀ who are standing firm.   "I will not allow them to come and survey my land. I have an Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́-given right to protect my property," she said. E-mail to a friend .

Èkó Ìjọba, Ọ̀ṣogbo (CNN) -- Some Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ congregations, particularly in lower income, urban areas, are turning to an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalikely source for help -- Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà. Rev, Àjànákú uses Scientology foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader Àṣàlẹ̀ book during a Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday night sermon. Scientologists do not worship God, much less Àkíntúndé. The church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult. So why are observant Àwọn Ìjọba embracing some of its teachings? Two pastors who spoke recently with CNN explained that when it comes to religion, they still preach the core beliefs of Àwọn Ìpínlẹ̀. But when it comes to practicing what they preach in a modern world, borrowing from Scientology helps. The Rev. Àjànákú, of the Glorious Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal church in Èkó Ìlú, Ọ̀ṣogbo, and the Rev. Tèmítọ́pẹ́, of the Wayman Chapel Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde Methodist Episcopal Church in Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode, Ìkìrè, are among the theological hybrids.  Watch Rev. Adéṣínà preach » . They say they are not scared off by programs with ties to a church that critics say has aggressive recruiting, secretive ways and rigid theology. As men of God rooted in Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ values, they do not see Scientology as a threat to their faith, but rather as a tool to augment it. Scientology was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded in the 1950s by Ọládùn, a science fiction writer. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ollowers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans. Although the church says there is a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè being, its practices do not include worshipping God. "I'm looking for solutions, and the people that I help, they don't ask me who Ọládùn is," said Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé, who works with addicts. "You know what they say? 'Thank God.' " Critic Ọlátúndé, a court-certified Scientology expert, sees something more sinister at work. He warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the Scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal -- new recruits. "Their hope is that through these programs, people will become more interested in Ọládùn, what else Mr. Hubbard had to offer, and this will lead them eventually to Scientology," Ìyábọ̀lá said. The church has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cult-like mind control. It is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers. And according to published reports, Scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups. Adéṣínà, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé and a handful of other Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ church leaders -- no one can say how many -- are finding answers to their commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities' needs in Scientology's social programs. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or Adéṣínà, it began two years ago when he attended a meeting at Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, Ọ̀ṣogbo. He was introduced to a book called "The Way to Happiness" -- Hubbard's 64-page, self-described "common sense guide to better living." In the book, which lays out ways to maintain a temperate lifestyle, Adéṣínà foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba congregation. He said the book's 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment where there is too much crime and addiction and too little opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity. Adéṣínà knew that before he could introduce any Scientology-related text to his congregation, he would have to prove that it did not contradict his Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ beliefs. And so, he foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad Scripture to match each of the 21 principles. Now Adéṣínà uses "The Way to Happiness" as a how-to supplement to his sermons. He believes it is easier to Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand and clearer to follow than ancient Scriptures taken from the Ìtàn Ọmọde. When asked whether Scientology's values contradict the religion of Àkíntúndé, Adéṣínà replies, "Sometimes yes. Sometimes no." But he says his congregation can relate to "The Way to Happiness." Adéṣínà admits other pastors have criticized him, but the disapproval is not enough to discourage him. He insists that he has witnessed the changes "The Way to Happiness" has inspired in people. He also maintains that the Scientologists, many of whom he calls friends, are successful at outreach and getting desired results. At Adéṣínà's Ọlákànmí, free tutoring based on Hubbard's "study tech" philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults. Adéṣínà's daughter, Jimirra, is one of the instructors. She said "study tech" and the Scientology orientation classes she attended helped her graduate from high school and become a poised woman. Though Ìbítọ́lá insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of Scientology, she still considers herself, at least in part, Scientologist. "We say this all the time and I know my father says this, but I am like a Pentecostal Scientologist, that's what we are." Critics like Ìyábọ̀lá are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines. They consider it a marketing win for Scientology. In Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé says he is not one to argue with success. Driven by a need to address the rampant drug problem in his commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé spent years searching for a solution before he discovered "Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè," Scientology's nonprofit drug rehab center, in 2001. Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé trained at Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè and brought the techniques back to his commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity to laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígach "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irst Step Ọjà Àgbẹ̀aith Step," a program that comỌlákúnlées Hubbard's methods with the teachings of Àwọn Ìpínlẹ̀. He claims a 70- to 80-percent rehabilitation success rate. Adéṣínà and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé said they have never lost a member of their congregations to Scientology. "I think that they truly believe that this may help their commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities, but in my opinion, they're naïve," Ìyábọ̀lá said. Scientologists, he added, "have their own agenda." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára would not grant CNN an interview, nor would its representatives answer questions about the Hubbard-based programs.  E-mail to a friend .

SẸ̀sìnSEX, Ìjẹ̀bú (CNN) -- Suspended Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú quarterback Ọláfẹ́mi must adhere to tightened restrictions after he tested positive for Ọlálékan use, a federal judge said Wednesday. Suspended Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú quarterback Ọláfẹ́mi tested positive for Ọlálékan in a September 13 drug test. Olúwáfémi tested positive for the drug on September 13, a court document from Ọ̀dọ̀-Òkè of Ìjẹ̀bú shows. As a result, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ District Judge Òlámídì ordered Olúwáfémi to "submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance."

Olúwáfémi faces a possible prison term of 12 to 18 months after his August guilty plea to federal conspiracy charges related to dogfighting on his property in Àkúrẹ́, Ìjẹ̀bú.

Ìjẹ̀bú, Ẹkólùmò (CNN) -- Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Òlámídì and Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá clowned aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad and marveled at their band's amazing impact in an interview Tuesday on CNN's "Àjànákú."

"And, yes, it is quite amazing, because as time goes on, it kind of becomes more and more of a phenomenon." Ọlákúnlé said the early Beatles knew they were a good band and were pretty sure of themselves, but Àṣàkẹ́ said, "We thought we'd be really big in Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́." "I think the most exciting thing is that, you know, we expect people our age to know the music. But actually, a lot of kids know the music," Àṣàkẹ́ said. "And if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that's the important part, not the moptops or whatever." The pair appeared relaxed in sneakers and almost matching black suits and joked frequently -- often at each other's expense. "They were nothing," Àṣàkẹ́ said of his former bandmates. "And then I joined and then they got this record deal and look what happened." "No, we were good," Ọlákúnlé retorted. "You wanted to join us. You begged to join us." "I didn't beg," Àṣàkẹ́ said.  Olúwáfémi and Ìjèbú-Ìgbo talk about the Beatles' magic » . Ọlákúnlé and Àṣàkẹ́ were in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé with Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi and Ọládélé, the widows of Dúrójaiyé and Ọlátúnjí, to celebrate the anniversary of Ọlálékàn "Àtẹ̀jáde Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ílíìmù," which uses the Beatles' music. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ said her husband was friends with Àkánní foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader Ọládàpọ̀ and came up with the idea before he died of cancer in 2001. "George was aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad just long enough to transmit that to all of us," Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ said. Ono said she wasn't sure at first what her husband would have thought about the project. Dúrójaiyé was shot near the couple's Ìjẹ̀ṣà apartment in 1980. "Now I really know that Ọlálékan would be very happy with this," she said. Neither woman has remarried and they both said it was still sometimes difficult to deal with their losses. "We feel so strongly about our husbands that sometimes it's hard for us, isn't it?" Ono said. "It's hard, you know," Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ said. "I mean their presence is very powerful and very strong. But the incredible thing about them is that they -- everything they left the world and left us is uplifting and joyful." The Beatles' music received a bit of a facelift for the show and has been remixed in 5.1 surroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. (An album, "Àtẹ̀jáde Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ílíìmù," came out last year.) "Ọlábísí and I went to listen to the music in 5.1 and we go 'Whoa, listen to that,' " Àṣàkẹ́ said. "You know you can hear everything now. Things that we buried a lot. It's all very clear, so it's really great to hear it." "Most historic stuff goes down with age, you know?" Ọlákúnlé added. "Àkínwùmi old papers go brown and crinkly, while our music gets brighter and shinier." "Next year, it will be 10.1," Àṣàkẹ́ joked. Ọlákúnlé's latest solo album, "Memory's Almost Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ull," is No. 3  on the album charts and Àṣàkẹ́ is scheduled to release a greatest hits album in August. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- Three Àwọn Ìgbò, including two sick children, have died recently while waiting for resettlement from Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára refugee agency said on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò goodwill ambassador Ọlábísí visits the Ọlákúnlé refugee camp in August. About 2,000 Àwọn Yorùbá refugees are stranded in camps along the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú border and face difficult living conditions, including limited medical care, the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency has appealed for the resettlement of "vulnerable and sick" children in Ọlákúnlé refugee camp at the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde-Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú border. One of those who died in the camp was a 3-year-old Àwọn Yorùbá boy who was suffering from rickets and pneumonia. He died a few days ago in a Ramadi hospital and then was buried in Ọlákúnlé. The other was a 14-year-old suffering from Hodgkin's disease who died in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ last week. A 50-year-old man who was waiting to be resettled died earlier this month in Ọlákúnlé. The agency says seven people, including three children, have died at the camp since refugees fleeing attackers began arriving at the border in March 2006. About 30 to 40 people arrive at the Ọlákúnlé camp each week, the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò reports. The agency has been pursuing medical resettlement. "Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò has helped resettle one family of eight with several sick children from this camp to Lágosì last August. Another 11 medical cases submitted for resettlement are awaiting approval," the agency said, which is working to identify other medical cases. And it is urging the resettlement of the entire group. "Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò has sought solutions for the whole group since last year and has only received positive indications from Ìfẹ̀ and Ẹ̀pẹ̀," the agency said. Thousands of Àwọn Ìgbò have lived in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, with some going there when Ọ̀ṣogbo was formed and others born there. The Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò notes that some got "preferential treatment" Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the regime of former Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde President Túbọ̀sún. But they have been the targets of violence since he was toppled. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò planes and ships were searching Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday for a Àwọn Èdá balloonist who disappeared off the Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà coast while flying from Ẹ̀ṣin to Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀ Èkó Ìjọba. Missing Àwọn Èdá balloonist Olúwatóbilọ́lá (R) with Olúṣọlá. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riends of balloonist Olúwatóbilọ́lá, who was on a solo flight, last heard from him via satellite phone at 9 a.m. Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà time (6 p.m. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀) Thursday, said Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́G Petty Officer Ọlákúnlé. When he missed three subsequent scheduled calls over the next six hours, they called Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde, Read said. Read said two Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé C130 Hercules planes conducted searches Thursday 435 miles south of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà, the balloonist's last known position. The searches continued Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday and are ongoing, Read said. Two Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé cutters are also headed for the area, but both are at least a day away, he said. Read said the balloonist, who was heading for Èkó, Ìjẹ̀ṣà, is equipped with provisions and a survival suit. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé holds the world record for the longest-duration balloon flight, with a time of 50 hours and 38 minutes, according to Ọjà Ọbá. In that January 1997 flight, he and Ayọ̀míde flew from the Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Ayé provionce of Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ to the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ state of Ìlọrin, according to the federation. E-mail to a friend .

Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá (CNN) -- Sens. Kúnlé and Òlámídì will duel for Super Tuesday votes Thursday night as the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential hopefuls face off for the first time together minus former Sen. Ọlámidé. Thursday's debate is taking place at Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in Ẹkólùmọ̀, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá. The debate -- sponsored by CNN, Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá and Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró -- starts at 8 p.m. ET Thursday on CNN and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà. CNN's Ọlákànmí is the moderator. The event is the first Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà debate since Ìbítọ́lá's convincing victory Saturday in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀. On Tuesday, Ọlákànmí won the Ọ̀ṣogbo primary, a contest her campaign said helped the senator regain momentum even though it awarded no delegates. The forum at Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé comes hours after the Ìbítọ́lá campaign revealed it had raised $32 million in January from roughly 170,000 new donors. That amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat will allow Ìbítọ́lá to expand his television ad buys greatly in the 20-plus states holding primaries or caucuses Tuesday.  Watch a time-lapse construction of the debate set » . The Ọlákànmí campaign would not indicate how much money it had raised in the same time period. Ọlábísi, the other Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential candidate still in the race, was not invited to participate in the debate because he did not meet certain criteria, including support in national polls. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted January 14-17, Gravel received less than 1 percent. Edwards suspended his presidential rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Wednesday in Ẹ̀tó, Lágosì, but he didn't endorse any candidate despite what aides described as furious lobbying campaigns by Ìbítọ́lá and Ọlákànmí. Thursday's debate may be slightly more restrained than last week's brutal showdown. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ollowing her Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ loss, Ọlákànmí has largely steered clear of opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities to take aim at Ìbítọ́lá. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer President Ẹ̀míọlá also has avoided criticizing his wife's rival after dominating headlines with his attacks in the days before the Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ vote. The economy is likely to dominate Thursday's debate, as both candidates look to appeal to supporters of Edwards and his brand of economic populism. Ọlákànmí and Ìbítọ́lá have split victories in their parties' early-voting states: Ìbítọ́lá has won in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, and Ọlákànmí has won in Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, Ẹkólùmò, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ and Ọ̀ṣogbo. But the Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ and Ọ̀ṣogbo contests awarded no delegates, and all major Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential candidates pledged to avoid campaigning in those states following national party penalties against them for moving up their contests so early. Ọlákànmí was the only major candidate to appear on the Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ ballot. Ìbítọ́lá is leading Ọlákànmí in the number of pledged delegates -- those awarded based on primary or caucus votes. Ọlákànmí has the edge when superdelegates are factored in. (Àwọn Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ are party leaders and elected officials who are not obligated to support a particular candidate. They can change their decisions at any time leading up to Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà in August.) To date, Ìbítọ́lá has won an estimated 63 national convention delegates as a result of primary or caucus votes, while Ọlákànmí has earned an estimated 48 delegates. Ọlákànmí, however, has the overall lead in delegates -- 232 to 158 -- when superdelegates are included. With solid fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadraising numbers and a nod from Sen. Ọlámidé of Ẹ̀gùn this week, Ìbítọ́lá will be making the claim he holds the front-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganer title. But Ọlákànmí -- who has led in national surveys for much of the race -- will be making her case as well. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Adéọlá contributed to this report.

Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn, Ìjèbú-Ìgbo (CNN) -- A car bomb struck a Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú vehicle Tuesday as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Ìfẹ̀, killing at least three Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà civilian bystanders, according to Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà officials. Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà soldiers and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Ìfẹ̀. The driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries, and the sole passenger walked away Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígascathed, Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga spokesman Ọlábísi said. Both were Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà nationals, he said. An Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the spokesman said. Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà internal security forces said three Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Ìfẹ̀'s Ẹ̀bùnọlá area, contradicting earlier reports of four. Twenty-one others -- including the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ bystander -- were woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded in the explosion, which was caused by a 15-kilogram (33-poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad) bomb placed in a car before the explosion, the security forces said. Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ is outraged by the terrorist attack, said Secretary of State Olúwatóbilọ́lá, who is traveling with President Olúṣọlá in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. "I want on behalf of our coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry to say to those who were woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded, and certainly to the families of those who were killed, that our condolences are with them," she added. It was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb. A commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaique issued by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo in Ìfẹ̀ said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack, and identified the driver and passenger as Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà security personnel for the embassy. But Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target. "We don't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened, who is responsible, who is exactly being targeted," he told reporters during Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ daily briefing. "We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us." Citing security concerns, Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé would also not address Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ Ambassador to Ìjèbú-Ìgbo Ànítá. A Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú statement said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀eltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night "out of respect to the victims of today's terrorist explosion." In addition to the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́, an Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde and at least three Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà were among those woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded in the blast, according to a Western diplomatic source. Video of the scene showed several damaged cars, including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal. A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage. Ọláwálé, senior adviser to Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà Prime Minister Ọlákúnlé, pointed out that the attack happened during "a major political crisis" in Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud. "This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation," Abẹ́òkúta told CNN. Tuesday's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against Àwọn Ìròyìn, Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà targets in the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà capital. Most recently, an explosion in Ìfẹ̀'s Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Ọlátúndé, the head of operations for the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà army, and his bodyguard on December 12. Ṣọlá was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Adébáyọ̀ was elected to replace Ọláfẹ́mi as president. Ìjèbú-Ìgbo has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president. The nation has been without a president since November 23, when the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ọdọ́ Adéọlá stepped down at the end of his term. In Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 2005, the assassination of former Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà Prime Minister Ọládàpọ̀ in Ìfẹ̀ sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú forces from Ìjèbú-Ìgbo.
