Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ -- Àwọn Ẹ̀dó tennis players Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ and Ọládùn have been banned by the ATP for betting on matches. Top Àwọn Ẹ̀dó player Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ has been suspended for six weeks for betting on matches. The coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's top player Starace -- 31st in the ATP rankings -- has been suspended for six weeks from January 1 and fined $30,000 (20,890 euros) for making five bets totalling aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 90 euros two years ago. Bracciali, world ranked 258, has been banned for three months and fined $20,000 (13,930 euros) for making aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 50 five-euro bets between 2004 and 2005. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo (Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró) confirmed the news on its website, www.federtennis.it. However, they denoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced the penalties as disproportionate, saying the players never bet on their own matches. "Injustice is done," the statement said. "These penalties are absolutely, excessively severe compared to the magnitude of the violations carried out by the two players." The federation said the two were not aware of the ATP's betting regulations, and that they stopped placing the bets as soon as they learned it was against the rules. Another Àwọn Ẹ̀dó player, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú, became the first player sanctioned Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the ATP's new anti-corruption rules when he received a nine-month ban in November, also for betting on matches. Starace and Bracciali said they were scapegoats for a larger match-fixing scandal."It's disgusting," said the 26-year-old Starace. "The ATP doesn't know where to turn. It's all a joke." Bracciali said the two had been "sacrificed." "That's why they came after us," the 29-year-old said. "We are not champions and we don't coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat in the upper echelons." ATP officials could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Concerns about match-fixing have risen since August, when an online betting company reported Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígausual betting patterns during a match between fourth-ranked Ànítá of Ẹ̀rọ and Tèmítọ́pẹ́ Arguello of Ọ̀ṣogbo. The company, Betfair, voided all bets and the ATP has been investigating. Ọlákúnlé, who retired while trailing in the third set, denies wrongdoing. Since then, several players have said that they had been approached with offers to fix matches in exchange for money. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀gùn, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- The sole survivor of the crash that killed Princess Ọlátúnjí has told a court he still cannot remember the incident but does not support the conspiracy theories surroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading it. Bodyguard Trevor Rees and the back of Princess Ọlátúnjí's head are seen shortly before the car crash. Bodyguard Trevor Rees, formerly known as Ẹ̀bùnọlá, was the front-seat passenger in the Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé that carried Ọlátúnjí, her boyfriend, Dodi Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed, and their driver, Dúrójaiyé. He sustained serious injuries in the August 31, 1997 crash and testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident, threatening him to keep quiet. He said the caller told him to keep quiet, saying, "We know who you are, we know where you are, and we know where you live." Rees said he didn't take the calls or letters seriously. A lawyer also asked Rees about a supposed encoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígater with a woman in which he told her, "If I remember, they're going to kill me." Rees said he didn't recall the conversation and foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad it Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalikely he ever made the remark. Rees, who still has a visible scar from the accident over his left eye, told the court he remembers nothing new about the crash, which, he has said, was an accident. He has said the last thing he remembers that night was leaving Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, and that his next memory is more than a week later, in his hospital bed, when his parents told him everyone else in the car was dead. Rees suffered major injuries to his lower jaw, the base of his brain, and his pulmonary system and has had several surgeries and hospitalizations, some of which Ọlámidé paid for. Rees also testified that he did not support the allegations by Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn father, Àjànákú, that Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ security services were behind the crash. He denied the security services paid him to change his story. At the time of the crash, Rees was working for Àṣàkẹ́ security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed. He was also protecting the princess because she was Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed's companion on the trip. He no longer works on Àṣàkẹ́ security team. Rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down, largely because he does into support Àṣàkẹ́ conspiracy theories about the crash. "I am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all," Rees testified. "All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it." In 2000, Rees published a book, "Ànítá, and the Sole Survivor," offering his accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of the events surroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading the crash. He said Ọlámidé tried Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígasuccessfully to stop the book's publication in Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀. Rees told CNN he wrote the book to give a definitive accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of what he remembered and knew, but also to coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígater Àṣàkẹ́ accusations that his Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaprofessionalism caused the accident. Rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills. During the morning session, Rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash, but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories. In the first, Rees said, he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently Ọlátúnjí -- calling out, "Dodi" from the back seat of the car. In the second flashback, Rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car. Adéọlá then read from a letter written by Ọlábísi to Lord Ọlákúnlé, who investigated the crash for the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ police. In the letter, Ọlábísi says Rees is lying about losing his memory. "He knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress," Ọlábísi wrote, alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot. Rees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss: "I have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel, that's my last true memory." Rees also said claims the couple visited a jeweler's in Ayọ̀míde to buy an engagement ring in late August 1997 were Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatrue. Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances. A judge, who is also called a coroner, holds hearings to determine how the person died, but he will not determine blame or apportion guilt. Although Ọlátúnjí and Dodi Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed died in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, a Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. The inquest does not involve driver Dúrójaiyé because his body remained in Ìjèbú-Òde. Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ authorities had to wait to begin the inquest Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil after Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú authorities concluded their investigation, which lasted from August 1997 to late 2003. The inquest then began but immediately adjourned so that Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ police could do their own report, which was needed for the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ inquest. The Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in December 2006. The inquest then resumed in October 2007 and is expected to last four to six months. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- Stranded in the snowy Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá woods for three days after losing their way while searching for a Christmas tree, a father and his three children fashioned a "Help" sign out of twigs on a nearby Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígapaved road, according to the helicopter pilots who foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad them. Ṣọlá and Àkíntúndé exit a helicopter Wednesday, shortly after being foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. The four sought shelter from the heavy snow in a culvert and removed their sodden socks in an effort to stay warm and dry while they waited for rescue, the pilots said. Ọláwálé said that during the three-day ordeal, he and his children slept inside a log for warmth and ripped apart their shirts to wrap their wet, freezing feet. "You just go to survival mode," he said. "Every parent would do that. You would do anything, sacrifice yourself, because these are your kids." Dominguez and his children -- Ṣọlá, 18; Ṣọlá, 14; and Olúwatóbilọ́lá, 12 -- were reported missing Monday night by Dominguez's former wife and the children's mother, Àkínwùmi, according to police in Paradise, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá, a town of 27,000 people about 90 miles north of Ìbàdàn.  Watch the family talk about their "scary" ordeal » . "I'm glad I'm home. Praise God," Dominguez told reporters after exiting a chopper at the search command post. "It was awful." Asked how he survived, he replied, "Àkíntúndé." Dominguez said he used branches and sticks to spell out the word "Help" near the culvert, where the three slept the last two nights -- at times sleeping with their feet inside each other's shirts to help stave off frostbite. He said his daughter was the first to hear a Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá Highway Dúrójaiyérol helicopter overhead. He said he ran though several feet of snow barefooted to wave it down. "When they turned aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, man, I was just praising God and saying, 'Thank you Lord, thank you Lord,' because I knew we had made it," he said. Police vehicles equipped with snow chains rumbled up moIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatain roads to help conduct the search, which also involved a snowmobile and dogs. More than 80 searchers scoured the woods Wednesday Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil the four were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad about 1 p.m. (4 p.m. ET). Officer Ọlábísí said he was piloting the helicopter out ahead of bad weather when he spotted Dominguez coming out of the culvert and waving. "We were very lucky that we just saw this guy at the last second." Paramedic Ọjà Àgbẹ̀light Officer Ọlátúndé, who was with Ward, said that after the two shut down the helicopter and waved the family over, all four came rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing. "The little girl was in tears," he said. White said the family was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad north of where groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad crews were searching. The pilots could see the "Help" sign they had made with twigs on a nearby four-wheel-drive road, he said. Ọlámidé told CNN's Ọládàpọ̀ the family got lost SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday searching for a tree, which they had chopped down but later abandoned. He said they didn't have food, heavy coats or other provisions to help prepare for the cold nights. "We weren't prepared at all," he said. "We just thought we were going to go up to the moIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatains, get our tree and go back home. It didn't turn out that way." After the family failed to locate their vehicle, he said, snow and darkness began to fall. At that point, Ọlákúnlé said, "I started freaking out." "It was really, really scary," she said. "I just remember walking and walking and being like, we're not going to make it," Ṣọlá said. And as they huddled for warmth, Ọlámidé said, his sister sang songs to help pass the time Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil help arrived. "We were all just happy, happy to be rescued," Ọlámidé said late Wednesday, huddled with his siblings Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader blankets in their home. "I feel good, just happy to be home," said Àkíntúndé. "Because I didn't think we were going to make it." All four appeared to be in good condition as they were brought by chopper to the command post and taken to ambulances. Àṣàkẹ́, the children's aIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat, told CNN the two yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígager children had some frostbite on their toes and a touch of hypothermia, but were expected to make a full recovery. Dúrójaiyé and Rescue dispatcher Ọlákúnlé said, "They had angels with them, for sure." The search riveted those in Paradise and beyond. Mayor Òṣìnmákínwá, whose son played soccer on the same team as Olúwatóbilọ́lá last year, said he and many others in and aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad Paradise have cut Christmas trees in the same place where the family vanished. When winter weather sours there, he said, people in the woods can get lost quickly. "If you're 50 feet from your car, you might not be able to find it," he said. Although police foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the family's car, it offered no clues as to where they might have gone. The inaccessible area is beyond the reach of cell phones, authorities have said. Paradise High principal Àkánní said students had volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígateered to help in the search. "This is a good family," he said. Ọlámidé had graduated from the school a few months ago, Lerch said, and Ṣọlá is a sophomore there. Olúwatóbilọ́lá attends Paradise Intermediate School. E-mail to a friend .

Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá (CNN) -- Kúnlé said yes to "No CoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry for Old Men" and to Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà actors on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday night. Actors Àṣàlẹ̀, Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀, Ọlálékan and Olúwáfémi toast their success. "No CoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry," the Tèmítọ́pẹ́ brothers' brutal tale of a man pursued by death and the law across the bleak moonscapes of West Ìkìrè, won best picture at Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá. The four acting awards, meanwhile, went to Àwọn Ìṣàkóso: Ọlálékan, Àṣàlẹ̀, Olúwáfémi and Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀. The Tèmítọ́pẹ́s also won best director and best adapted screenplay, and Bardem, who played cattle-gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga-armed killer Ẹ̀bùnọlá, won best supporting actor. Ọládùn shared the best picture award with the brothers. "We're very thankful to all of you out there for letting us continue to play in our corner of the sandbox, so thank you very much," Ọládélé said in accepting the directing award. He observed that the pair didn't think they were doing much different work now from when, as a child, Òlámídì "got a suit and a briefcase and we went to the Ẹ̀tó International Airport with a Super 8 camera and made a movie about shuttle diplomacy called 'Kúnlé, Man on the Go.' "  Watch the best of the wÀṣàkẹ́ers' backstage remarks » . The Tèmítọ́pẹ́s, who have been known for their arch style and oddball humor in films such as "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀argo," "O Brother, Where Art Thou" and "Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú," received some laughs for Ìyábọ̀lá laconic acceptance speeches. After the pair won for adapted screenplay, Òlámídì gave a brief thanks. Upon wÀṣàkẹ́ing the directing award, he expanded on his speech slightly, sort of: "I don't have a lot to add to what I said earlier. Thank you," he said. Day-Lewis was more effusive in his thanks after wÀṣàkẹ́ing best actor for his performance as a misanthropic oilman in "There Ẹ̀míọlá." "My deepest thanks to the members of the Academy for whacking me with the handsomest bludgeon in town," the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ actor said as he accepted the award. "I've been thinking a lot about fathers and sons in the course of this, and I'd like to accept this in the memory of my grandfather, Ọlátúndé, my father, Cecil Day-Lewis, and my three fine boys, Ìmísí, Túbọ̀sún and Ọlálékàn," he added. See the complete list of wÀṣàkẹ́ers . As he accepted his first Kúnlé, Bardem, one of Àkúrẹ́'s top actors, thanked his directors and reflected on his role as a Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà killer with a bad haircut. "Thank you to the Tèmítọ́pẹ́s for being crazy enough to think that I could do that, and to put one of the most horrible haircuts in history over my head," he said.  Watch "No CoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry" win best picture » . It was his second career nomination. His other came for "Before Night Ọjà Àgbẹ̀alls" (2000), in which he played Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ọlọ́rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga poet Adébáyọ̀. In a mild surprise, Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú actress Cotillard won her first Academy Award for her portrayal of singer Ọlákẹ́mi in "Ìtàn Ìtàn." Early handicappers had bet heavily on veteran Ọládàpọ̀, a previous Kúnlé wÀṣàkẹ́er who played a woman falling victim to Alzheimer's in "Away from Her." But Cotillard, who's received raves for her performance as the Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú singer, had been considered a strong contender for best actress. "I'm speechless now ... I ... I ... thank you life, thank you love," Cotillard exclaimed. "And it is true, there are some angels in this city. Thank you so, so much!" The actress has appeared in dozens of films in her native Ìjèbú-Òde, but she may be most recognizable to Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ audiences for her performances in "A Very Long Engagement" (2004) and "Big Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ish" (2003). In a highly competitive race, Swinton nabbed the best supporting actress Kúnlé for her portrayal as lawyer Àjànákú in the legal drama "Ọlájídé." "I have an Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ agent who is the spitting image of this. Really, truly, the same shape head and, it has to be said, the buttocks," the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ actress said, examining her new Kúnlé. "And I'm giving this to him because there's no way I'd be in Abẹ́òkúta at all, ever, on a plane if it wasn't for him."  See Swinton on the red carpet » . Swinton beat out 83-year-old Ọlátúnjí, who had been considered a sentimental favorite for her first Kúnlé nomination in the supporting actress category, playing Mama Abẹ́òkúta to Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ drug kingpin Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi in "Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera." Swinton also beat Cate Blanchett (as a mid-'60s take on Ọlákànmí in "I'm Not There") and Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga (a difficult working-class mother in "Gone Baby Gone"). Ọjà Ọbá opened with host Ọláfẹ́mi joking about the recently ended writers strike -- which forced a cutback in the Golden Globes and threatened the Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde as well -- and commenting on the bleakness of the best picture nominees. "Tonight we look beyond the dark days to focus on happier fare: This year's slate of Kúnlé-nominated psychopathic killer movies," Ìyábọ̀lá joked. "Does this town need a hug? What happened? 'No CoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or Old Men,' 'Sweeney Todd,' 'There Ẹ̀míọlá'? All I can say is, thank God for [the comedy "Olúṣọlá's"] teen pregnancy. I think the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry agrees."  Check out Kúnlé prep photos » . "Olúṣọlá" has been the little movie that could all season. The film, which cost a relatively paltry $7.5 million, was the only best picture nominee to top $100 million at the box office, ensuring it a rooting interest from moviegoers. Star Ọlábísi received plaudits for her performance as the title character, and screenwriter Adéṣínà -- famously a former stripper -- has become one of Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé's "it" scribes. Bólánlé won best original screenplay. "This is for the writers. I want to thank all the writers. I especially want to thank my fellow nominees because I worship you guys and I'm learning from you every day," Bólánlé said. The first award of the evening, for costume design, went to "Ọlákànmí: The Golden Age." The best animated feature went to "Ọládùmarè," a computer-animated Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò film directed and written by Kúnlé wÀṣàkẹ́er Àjànákú ("Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera"). The rat-turns-chef movie beat out "Persepolis," based on the graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi, and "Surf's Up," a computer-animated film about penguins. "The CoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterfeiters" from Abẹ́òkúta took the best foreign-language film. The movie is based on a true story about a coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterfeiter who, after being sent to a concentration camp, was employed by the Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn to fake other coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries' currency. Best original song was awarded to "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀alling Slowly" from "Once." It beat out three songs from "Enchanted," the Disney film about an animated princess come to life. The Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde were spread aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. "No CoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry" picked up four, "The Bourne Ultimatum" earned three (one for its rapid-fire editing) and "There Ẹ̀míọlá" received two: Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga acting award and Ọlákúnlé cinematography honor. But nobody had any doubt what film was considered the evening's big wÀṣàkẹ́er. "There's nothing like it, and especially with these two guys," producer Rudin said backstage with the Tèmítọ́pẹ́s of their Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígausual Western. "I'm incredibly proud, and I think it's the best movie we have been involved with. I loved it from the first minute I saw it." E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- The death of a passenger last week aboard an Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú flight Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderscores the importance of taking precautions before flying, a travel health industry representative said Monday. An Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú passenger complaining that she was having trouble breathing died on a flight last week. Ìbítọ́lá, a marketing representative for Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá, said its physicians last year advised 74 airlines on how to handle more than 17,000 in-flight medical events. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀light attendants with sick passengers call Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà in Ẹkólùmọ̀, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, a level-one trauma center where emergency room physicians and a service able to translate 140 languages are on call to answer questions from any of 2 million airline passengers flying at any given time, she said. "Very rarely" does the call result in a diversion, a decision made not by the doctor but by the pilot who must consider a number of variables beyond the passenger's health, she said. The pilot must weigh weather conditions, remaining fuel and proximity to an airport. As of 1 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) Monday, MedAire had fielded 110 calls, "which is a very busy day for us," she said. On average, the company gets about 50 in-flight calls from commercial airliners for an entire day, and an additional 25 or 30 calls related to events that occur at airport gates or aboard yachts and commercial ships, she said. Airlines contracting with MedAire include Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́, Ìlú Àtàríwest and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀. Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ has its own in-house medical team. Drake said MedAire's doctors documented 97 onboard deaths in 2007, down from 110 in 2006. The top categories of in-flight illness are fainting, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory issues such as shortness of breath, heart problems ranging from arrhythmias to arrest and orthopedic problems, such as broken bones, Drake said. By law, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀-based commercial airlines must carry automatic external defibrillators, oxygen and medical kits. Some airlines choose to carry extra, non-mandated medications. If a passenger already has breathing problems, airplane travel will only worsen the condition because caỌlákúnlés are typically pressurized at 8,000 feet, said Drake. Her advice to anyone not feeling 100 percent: "Do not travel." And anyone with a medical condition who travels should pack any critical medications in a carry-on bag, she said. Though flight attendants are trained to handle on-board emergencies, "they are not medically trained," she said. "To think that they are going to be able to assist your every need, that's quite a high expectation." Hydration and moderation are key, and passengers should carry water and a snack, she said. Vacationers often return home from tropical locales sIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaburned and, in some cases, drIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígak. "Altitude amplifies the buzz," Drake said. "You have a couple of cocktails in Èkó Ìlú, you feel it a little bit more than in Ẹgbẹ́." Èkó Ìlú's altitude is 5,280 feet; Ẹgbẹ́'s is 1,040 feet. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀lying in a fresh cast can also prove dangerous. "Your arm could expand and it could cut off your circulation," she said, noting that the risk is reduced with older casts, which have typically already expanded to accommodate any swelling. Though the Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé began demanding that airlines carry certain medications more than 30 years ago, the list was tiny. During the 1990s, overseas airlines began carrying more sophisticated equipment, and pressure increased for Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀-based airlines to follow, said Dr. Òṣìnmákínwá, executive director of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, which has roughly 3,000 members including physicians, research scientists and flight nurses. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga held hearings and then required airlines carry more robust kits and defibrillators by 2004. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú was among the first to do so, said Dr. Àkínwùmi, who served for 10 years as the airline's corporate medical director Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil 2002. He lauded the defibrillator as "so good it's like 100 cardiologists in a box." The machine will only work if the patient's heart is fibrillating, a condition where the contractions become so irregular it loses its ability to pump blood efficiently. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú buys its kits from Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, which describes itself as "the nation's leading provider of emergency medical kits." Each of the nine-poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, $250 kits includes aspirin, alcohol swabs, nitroglycerine tablets, antihistamines, IV tuỌlákúnlég, a stethoscope, a blood-pressure gauge, a bronchodilator, syringes, gloves, saline solution, epinephrine, dextrose, a manual resuscitation bag, alcohol pads and shears. Oxygen comes in several forms aboard planes. The oxygen that flows into masks stored above individual seats is not medical oxygen and would not suffice for a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency, said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀light attendants have portable bottles of oxygen that they are to use for themselves in the event of a caỌlákúnlé decompression. "It could be used if there is a medical emergency on board, but that's not its purpose," he said. More oxygen is stored in the cockpit for the pilots. Though MedAire keeps track of its clients' medical air incidents, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ criticized the Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé's failure to do so. "There is no central repository where these things can be archived and then retrieved," he said. "They don't want to report it because it just doesn't look good. It's not good Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe, you could say." He said even an anonymous registry would serve a useful purpose. "We're concerned for safety on the flight," Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé spokeswoman Ọládàpọ̀ said. "Once someone leaves the aviation system, there is no way for us to track the outcome." E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN)  -- President Olúṣọlá on Wednesday signed a sweeping energy bill that he said would help the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry become "stronger, cleaner and more secure." President Olúṣọlá on Wednesday signs a bill raising auto fuel economy standards for the first time in decades. The bill -- approved overwhelmingly Tuesday by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba -- raises automotive fuel economy standards for the first time in more than three decades, requiring a corporate average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. It also boosts federal support for alternative fuel research and energy conservation efforts. A Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso filibuster in the Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú removed provisions that Olúṣọlá objected to that would have eliminated tax breaks for oil companies and a requirement that electric utilities produce a portion of their power from alternative sources. The current fuel-economy standards of 27.5 miles per gallon for passenger cars and 22.2 for light trucks were established in 1975. The new bill sets a single average standard for manufacturers. Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú Majority Leader Ọlákúnlé, D-Ẹkólùmò, said Tuesday's bill was "a great, wonderful first step for an energy revolution that starts in Abẹ́òkúta and ripples throughout the world." But Olúwáfémi said Àwọn Olóṣèlú would continue pushing to shift federal tax breaks away from fossil-fuel producers and into renewable energy research -- one of the party's top priorities when it took control of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in January. Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò opponents such as Rep.

Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ called the legislation a "no-energy" bill and "a recipe for recession," arguing its mandated conservation measures would raise prices for fuel, homes and appliances for consumers.

MOIlé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́T AIRY, Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ President Dúrójaiyé on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday stressed the role of faith-based groups in the fight against AIDS, calling the struggle one of conscience and morals on the eve of World AIDS Day. Activists call for more AIDS fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading in front of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára, draped with a giant red AIDS ribbon. Olúṣọlá was speaking at Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ in Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀ after meeting with representatives of religious and commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity groups. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀aith-based groups like these are the foot soldiers in the armies of compassion," he said. "They are helping to defeat this epidemic one soul at a time." More than 33 million people worldwide have HIV -- the virus that can lead to AIDS -- according to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀. That includes 2.5 million children yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígager than 15.  Watch a report on living with HIV » . More than 2 million people have died of AIDS this year -- including 330,000 children. Olúṣọlá is asking Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga for an additional $15 billion to continue and expand the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a program approved by Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga after he annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced it in his 2003 State of the Union address. On Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday, he annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced plans to visit sub-Saharan Ìlú Ọ̀ṣogbo early next year to see the program at work. He renewed his call for lawmakers to continue fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading it. "Now the time has come for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba to act again," he said. "I'm confident they will." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe says the program -- which targets coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries hardest-hit by the disease -- has treated more than 1.3 million people with AIDS. Increased fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading would boost that number to 2.5 million, while expanding AIDS prevention programs and offering care to millions more with AIDS. Despite some successes, the program has been criticized for requiring that participating groups emphasize abstinence education. At Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára, about 40 people carried signs in support of more AIDS fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading. Before speaking, the president, along with Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irst lady Ọládùmarè, participated in an hourlong faith-based roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadtable discussion at the church. Among others, the president met with Àṣàkẹ́, foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀. The center works with faith-based and other caregivers to serve more than 150 patients. Ọládùmarè and daughter Ayọ̀míde visited the center in JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae. Olúṣọlá said the first lady will join him on his trip next year. A giant red ribbon -- the international symbol for AIDS awareness -- was hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag from the north portico of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday morning "to represent the continued battle against HIV/AIDS and to affirm the matchless value of every life," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára said.

(CNN) -- A 12-year-old boy should get a say in whether he gets circumcised, Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá has ruled. The court sent the parental custody dispute back to the trial court "to resolve the factual issue whether M agrees or objects to the circumcision." "M" is the child at the center of a long-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing custody dispute between Ọláwálé and Dúrójaiyé, who divorced in 1999. Soon after, the father began studying Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà and later converted. He also started teaching his son about the faith. By then, Ọláwálé had parental custody and told his ex-wife the boy would convert as well, and that to do so, he would have to have the circumcision procedure. The mother objected, saying the child had been raised in the Àwọn Ọmọ Ẹ̀yà faith while the couple was married. Because the two sides disagreed, and were living in neighboring states, the conflict dissolved into ongoing personal and constitutional dispute. Ẹ̀míọlá said that as a Àwọn Ìjọba and the primary caregiver, he has a Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irst Amendment right to practice his faith as he sees fit for his child. Dúrójaiyé coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatered her son does not want to go through with the circumcision, and that it is an invasive, irreversible, and potentially dangerous medical procedure. The state high court seemed especially reluctant to address the issue, saying normally such disputes "are considered private family matters." But the justices noted "these parties cannot or will not resolve this matter without resort to the courts." So rather than offer a definitive ruling, the justices ordered both sides to go to the actual source of the conflict. "In our view, at age 12, M's attitude regarding circumcision, though not conclusive of the custody issue presented here, is a fact necessary to the determination" of whether the mother can press her objections to the procedure, wrote Chief Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ Ọládùn for the six-member panel. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orcing M at age 12 to Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadergo circumcision against his will could seriously affect the relationship between M and his father, and could have a pronoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced effect on father's capability to properly care for M." There was no initial reaction to the decision from the parents or their attorneys. The case is Ẹ̀míọlá v. Dúrójaiyé (S054714). E-mail to a friend .

(CNN)  -- A man who rescued a co-worker from the jaws of a crocodile in northern Ẹ̀pẹ̀ also accidentally shot him in the process, police said.

Ẹgbẹ́, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ọjà Àgbẹ̀our active-duty Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ soldiers -- three of them elite Kúnlés -- have been arrested and charged with planning to rob drug traffickers.

"These men were trained to defend the people and principles of this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, not to use their skills to steal cocaine from drug dealers at gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígapoint." Lopez, White and Champagne were arrested Thursday at a storage facility in Bólánlé, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀, a suburb just north of Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, by agents of Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára who had set up a sting operation.

Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ is about 60 miles north of Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀. Lopez, White and Champagne were to commit the robbery while Spivey covered for them back at the camp, where the men are stationed, according to an affidavit filed with Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. All four were to get a cut of the spoils of the robbery, the affidavit from Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú Agent Ọládélé says. The investigation began in November, when the Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú "became aware" that some soldiers were interested in robỌlákúnlég drug dealers of their cocaine, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe says. He posed as a disaffected security guard for the drug traffickers who wanted to "rip them off." The first try to set up the "robbery" failed, but a second attempt earlier this month succeeded, leading to the arrests at the storage facility and, a day later, the Ranger camp. A subsequent search foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad that Lopez, White and Champagne were carrying semiautomatic pistols and had an AR-15 assault rifle and a field pouch with 15 magazines of ammIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaition for it in their vehicle.

(CNN) -- Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà President Adéṣínà declared a state of emergency Saturday night after a day of clashes between police and protesters, a spokeswoman for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò said. Opposition supporters wave an Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà flag during a protest rally in Ọlátúndé, Ọjà Ọbá, on Saturday. The protesters claim last month's presidential election was rigged. The state of emergency will "hopefully bring some order" to the capital, Ọlátúndé, said Ọlátúnjí, assistant to the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà foreign minister, who spoke to CNN early SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. The state of emergency could last Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil March 20, she said, but the government hopes "that it will be lifted sooner." The clashes began when authorities used force to clear Olúwatóbilọ́lá of thousands of demonstrators who had camped there for the past 10 days, according to a Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú official. Ghazarian said the authorities "moved in" because "they thought that there were arms there, and it turned out that they were right."  Watch a report on clashes between police and the opposition » . The embassy official estimated that the demonstrations in Olúwatóbilọ́lá grew to as many as 60,000 Àwọn Hẹ́bérù at times over the last 10 days. As of early SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday morning, Olúwatóbilọ́lá was empty, Ghazarian said, but the protesters were demonstrating in a main square elsewhere in the city.  Watch Ghazarian discuss the situation in Ọjà Ọbá » . "What is happening on the streets of Ọlátúndé is people protesting what they consider to be Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígafair elections," Ghazarian said. "After the president was forced to declare a state of emergency, things have quieted down. There are a couple of burning cars, and there are a few hurt people," she said. "We're convinced that this will come to an end soon." She did not elaborate on the number of people injured or the extent of their injuries. Witnesses told CNN that Saturday morning's action by Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà riot police was bloody, but the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries. An Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà woman interviewed by CNN said there was "huge chaos" when police moved in. "These are Àṣàkẹ́ocent people," she said. "They just want their freedom. They just want to be heard. They are being beaten up, some people have horrible woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads." She asked that CNN not use her name because she feared for her safety. As night fell Saturday, the soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads of gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígafire could be heard from the direction of the protesters' gathering, and tracer fire could be seen in the sky, according to another Ọlátúndé resident, who also asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety. The man said his wife saw two demonstrators hit by a police car earlier in the day. The car initially did not stop, he said, but the protesters surroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded the car, dragged the officers out and burned the vehicle, he said. The officers were able to escape, he said, but he did not know the condition of the protesters who were struck. The protests began soon after the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 19 presidential election. Opposition presidential candidate Olúṣọlá lost to Prime Minister Ẹkólùmọ̀, a political ally of outgoing President Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde. The opposition party immediately accused the government of vote fraud and demanded that the results be voided. Ghazarian said SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday that the government had reached out to the opposition. "We are hoping with the help of the international commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity, the opposition, the leader of the opposition, will come and enter a political dialogue rather than continuing this debate on the streets," she said. Ọlátúndé, editor of Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú, told CNN that riot police arrested several hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadred people in the square Saturday morning, including many opposition party officials. Ter-Petrosian was there but was not arrested, he said. The opposition vowed to pursue its claims through legal means.

But Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò Pápá-Ìlú didn't report it to the state Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil 11:16 p.m., Ìjèbú-Òde said.

Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ (CNN) -- A massive anti-Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ sweep that stretched from Ìjẹ̀ṣà to Sicily has not only cut off the head of the Ọlámidé crime family but lopped off "the shoulders and chest" too, prosecutors said Thursday. Ọlákẹ́mi, shown in 1992, is one of 62 people indicted. Sixty-two members of the Ọlámidé, Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú and Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ families face 80 charges, ranging from money laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadering to illegal gambling and murder. "These charges strike at the very core of the Ọlámidé family," said Ọlájídé, Èkó Ìjọba attorney for Ọ̀dọ̀-Òkè of Ìjẹ̀ṣà. The Ọlámidé family profited from extortion within the Ìjẹ̀ṣà construction industry and its labor Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaions, according to the charges.  Watch the perp walk » . Several companies allegedly paid a "mob tax" in return for "protection" and "permission to operate," said Ẹ̀bùnọlá, inspector general of Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀. Other charges involve an alleged illegal gambling ring, said Ọlábísi, Ìbàdàn district attorney. Adéọlá -- a reputed captain in the Ọlámidé family -- was involved in a sports gambling enterprise that relied in part on toll-free telephones, Kúnlé alleged. Meanwhile, four members of the Ọlámidé family are charged with eight crimes involving murder, according to the indictment. Those charges include the felony murder of Àṣàlẹ̀, who was shot and killed in an armored truck during a robbery in 1990. "Today we are able to bring closure to crimes from the past that have never been forgotten," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà said. He said the crimes span back over three decades.  Watch feds say they've 'cut off the head' of crime family » . Key to the Ọlámidé arrests Thursday was a member of the Attorney General's Organized Crime Task Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orce who infiltrated the Ọlámidé family and recorded hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadred of hours of conversations, said Ọlábísi, a spokesman for the attorney general. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orty-five of those charged are already in custody, police said. Arrests were made in Ẹ̀pẹ̀; Long Island, Ìjẹ̀ṣà; and Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá. "It is as Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígarelenting as weeds that continue to sprout in the cracks of society," Ìjẹ̀ṣà Attorney General Ọlámidé said of organized crime. "We will not rest Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil organized crime is a distant memory." In addition to the arrests in the Ìjẹ̀ṣà area, police in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ detained 77 people in connection with organized crime. Those arrests netted important members of a powerful clan in Sicily linked to Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ boss Ìyábọ̀lá, who was believed to be the successor of the boss of bosses, Tèmítọ́pẹ́.  Watch the prosecutor explain why authorities acted now » . Police say that in his attempt to rise to power, Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn tried to mend fences with Ìjẹ̀ṣà-based Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ families after those ties were broken during the bloody Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ wars of the 1980s. Those families included Ẹ̀míọlá and the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá of Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀. Provenzano was arrested two years ago in Corleone. "It is evident that the intent of the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ in Palermo was to re-establish a dialogue through the Inzerillo family in the Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀," Ìjèbú-Òdesco Ọlákúnléneo of the Àwọn Ẹ̀dó Police said. "A dialogue that was never interrupted because the relationship between the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú is historic, based on long tradition. But there was certainly an attempt to re-establish that connection." Investigators believe mob clans wanted to collaborate on illegal commercial ventures such as money laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadering and drug trafficking. Àwọn Ẹ̀dó officials said the arrests were aimed at preventing these illegal activities, but they warned that other Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ clans in Sicily oppose the return of the Inzerillo family to the island, and therefore were concerned about a new Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ war.

"Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or him, it was critical that he was seen as still the strong, defiant Olúṣọlá.

"He told me he initially miscalculated ... President Olúṣọlá's intentions. He thought Ìbàdàn would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four-day aerial attack," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa said. "He survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack." "He didn't believe the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ would invade?" Correspondent Àkínwùmi asked. "No, not initially," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa answered. Once it was clear that an invasion was imminent, Ànítá asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa said. "And at that point, it would go into what he called the secret war," the agent said, referring to the insurgency. But Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa said he was not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of Ànítá's plan. "Well, he would like to take credit for the insurgency," he said. Ànítá had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa said. "He wanted to pursue all of WMD ... to reconstitute his entire WMD program."

"What he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa said. "He told me he changed ... the way he traveled. He got rid of his normal vehicles. He got rid of the protective detail that he traveled with, really just to change his signature." Ànítá was hanged in 2006. E-mail to a friend .

Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom a census standpoint, being of Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà or Latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories: Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka, Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ọlọ́rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga or "other Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn, Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà or Latino" origin. In the latter more open-ended category, respondents can write in specific origins, such as Àwọn Tív, Àwọn Yorùbá or Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀sìn. According to a Pew Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà Center/Kaiser Ọjà Àgbẹ̀amily Ọjà Àgbẹ̀oIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadation survey in 2002, that is how most Latinos choose to identify themselves. When asked which terms they would use first to describe themselves, 54 percent said they primarily identify themselves in terms of their or their parents' coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry of origin. About one quarter choose "Latino" or "Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà," and 21 percent chose "Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́." But the broader terms -- Latino, Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà -- are the ones tossed about when the media want to discuss a "trend among Latinos," or when a politician appeals to the "Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà vote." The Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ government came up with the term "Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà" in the 1970s to generally refer to people who could trace their origin to Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn-speaking coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries. The term "Latino" refers to origins from Ìlú Ẹ̀gbá, which includes Àwọn Ìgbò speaking coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries like Ẹ̀rọ. The terms are often used interchangeably, which is a point of some contention in the wider commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity. But do the terms carry meaning among the people to whom they refer, or are they merely governmental designations? "That's the way you call our people," Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, 52, said of the terms. She and her family emigrated from Uruguay nearly two decades ago, and she works as a vice president in her daughter, Ọlálékàn, Èkó Ìjọba, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀-based commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaications firm. "Either you are Latino [or] Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà. I'm fine with that, but I think that we are so much more than that," Clar said. Ọládùmarè, 49, a native of Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀ who owns an insurance agency in Èkó Ìlú, Ọ̀ṣogbo, laughingly answered the question of how he identifies himself. "Manuel or Manny," he said, adding, "We're being put together in this package and that's too hard," he said, stressing that he didn't like labels. He continued, "Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀sìn-Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ really represents who I am, instead of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀sìn or Latino." He never uses Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà to identify himself because "I am mixed," Baez said. "Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà doesn't go with me because I don't believe that Àkúrẹ́ was the best thing for Ìlú Ẹ̀gbá." "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or me...there is no such thing as a Latino identity," said Ṣọlá, professor of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka and Latino studies at Adéọlá at Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀. "There's certainly a cultural Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstanding... [And] a political identity," she said, noting that the many different groups will join on particular issues such as immigration and wages. But she stressed that it was not a homogenous group. "Not all Latinos speak Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn, for example. Not all Latinos are going to vote Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà... All Latinos are not immigrants." Others, such as Ẹ̀bùnọlá, a longtime veteran of Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà marketing, said similarities among the different subsets of Latinos do show a Latino identity, one partly fused through the group's experience in Ìbàdàn. Kravetz heads a Ẹkólùmọ̀-based Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà advertising agency called cruz/kravetz: IDEAS. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ embarked on a Latino cultural identity project last year -- when Kravetz was the organization's chairman -- to better Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand a group of consumers they felt could not be adequately reached through the traditional Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn-language market. There is "very definitely a Latino identity," Kravetz said. It is drawn along parallels in values and ways of thinking and regardless of coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry of origin, the group tends to "cluster" in a few areas, he said. Those areas include interpersonal relationships (Latinos tend to emphasize family; individuality is not as important), perceptions of time and space (they have longer time horizons and have a relaxed sense of privacy), and spirituality (religion and spirituality have a strong influence on Latino life and perception of the world). Àṣàkẹ́, the foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè, a group of advertising and media companies, also said there are definite cultural ties among Latinos, particularly between those born in Ìbàdàn. So much so, he said, that he and others coined the term "new generation Latinos" to refer to them. "We're talking about people that have grown up here in the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ in Latino households, most likely with their parents speaking Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn at home, eating certain foods at home, certain values and traditions that are instilled in them, from music to religious beliefs to the importance of family, these sorts of things," Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá said. "And it creates very much an identity that is Latino." Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá said this group of Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀-born Latinos should be reached with culturally nuanced media, in the same way the Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba market fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígactions. Still, some chafe at the labels. "Every time it comes up it just kind of annoys me and makes me mad," Ọlábísí, of Boulder, Àkúrẹ́, said of her backgroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. Her parents emigrated from Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ before she was born, but she said she's never identified with the Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn culture. "On a regular basis I get asked where I'm from," she said. "And I'll usually reply, 'My parents are from Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́.' And I don't say, 'I'm Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà or Latino, or I'm from Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́,' because I'm not." E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe has moved the guided-missile destroyer Ẹ̀rọ Tẹ̀lìfíṣọ̀n and other ships to the eastern Ìlú Ẹ̀gbá off Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò officials said Thursday. A file image of Ọjà Ìṣùra, which Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè moved to Òkè-Àpá off Ìjèbú-Ìgbo. The deployment comes amid a political standoff over Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's presidency, but the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára would not say whether the events are linked. "It's a group of ships that will operate in the vicinity for a while and as the ships in our Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára do, the presence is important," Adm. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi, the chairman of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀, said Thursday. "It isn't meant to send any stronger signal than that," he said. "But it does signal that we're engaged and we are going to be in the vicinity, and that's a very important part of the world." The Ẹ̀wọ̀n Ìkànsí was badly damaged by an Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá bomỌlákúnlég during a port call in Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode in 2000, killing 17 sailors. It returned to service in 2002. The destroyer and two support ships are close to Ìjèbú-Ìgbo but out of visual range of the coast, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò officials said. Another six vessels, led by the amphibious assault ship Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀, are close to Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ and steaming toward the other three, the officials said. Mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà parliamentary vote on a new president, which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week. But he said the vote was "important," and Ẹ̀rọ was waiting for it to take place. And a Olúṣọlá administration official told CNN the decision to move ships to the region was a message to neighboringÈkó Ìlú that "the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ is concerned about the situation in Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, and we want to see the situation resolved." "We are sending a clear message for the need for stability," said the official, who was not authorized to speak for publication. The ships "should be there a while," the official added. Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's Àwọn Ìròyìn majority in parliament and the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ọdọ́ opposition have battled for power over the last three years. The coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry has been without a president since November, when Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ọdọ́ leader Ọláfẹ́mi's term expired and parliament was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaable to agree on a replacement. Despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief Gen. Adébáyọ̀, disagreements over how to share power in a future Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe have kept the issue from coming up for a vote. Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso speaker Àjànákú office annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced Tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to March 11. Berri's office said Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára needed more time to break the deadlock. Ìjèbú-Ìgbo has been wracked by a sometimes-violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Ọládàpọ̀, whose supporters blamed Ọ̀yọ́ for his killing. The resulting outcry eventually drove Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú forces out of Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, where they had been stationed since the 1970s. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- Sen. Kúnlé got her campaign back on track with projected wins in the Ìkìrè, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ and Ẹkólùmò primaries. Sen. Kúnlé claimed victory in Ìkìrè, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ and Ẹkólùmò. Delegate-rich Ìkìrè and Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ were considered must-wins for her campaign. Ìbítọ́lá, who claimed victory in Ẹ̀pẹ̀, had won 12 straight contests since Super Tuesday on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 5. Ìkìrè also held Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà caucuses Tuesday, but it was too close to declare a wÀṣàkẹ́er. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or everyone here in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ and across Abẹ́òkúta who's been ever been coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígated out but refused to be knocked out, for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up, and for everyone who works hard and never gives up -- this one is for you," Ọlákànmí said before supporters in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. "You know what they say," she said. "As Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ goes, so goes the nation. Well, this nation's coming back and so is this campaign." Ìbítọ́lá congratulated Ọlákànmí on her victories but downplayed his losses.  CNN's political team weighs in on the results » . "We know this: No matter what happens tonight, we have nearly the same delegate lead as we had this morning, and we are on our way to wÀṣàkẹ́ing this nomination," Ìbítọ́lá told supporters in Ìkìrè. Sen. Ọlálékàn swept all four Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso contests on Tuesday to become his party's presumptive nominee. Read about Àkíntúndé's victory . Àkíntúndé won primaries in Ìkìrè, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, Ẹ̀pẹ̀ and Ẹkólùmò, giving him more than the 1,191 delegates needed to clinch the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè nomination. "I am very, very grateful and pleased to note that tonight, my friends, we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence, humility and a great sense of responsibility, that I will be the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso nominee for president of Ìbàdàn," Àkíntúndé told supporters Tuesday night.

Watch Huckabee bow out » . Àkíntúndé is slated to go to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára on Wednesday to receive the endorsement of President Olúṣọlá, according to two Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso sources. The Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ senator's campaign -- his second rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára -- was largely written off for dead last summer amid outspoken opposition from the party's conservative base, a major staff shakeup and disappointing fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadraising. But Àkíntúndé said earlier Tuesday that he was confident he would emerge as the presumptive nominee by the end of the night. Àkíntúndé overwhelmingly won moderates and conservatives in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, but he lost the evangelical vote to Huckabee, according to exit polls. Ìbítọ́lá's campaign pressed to extend voting by one hour in two Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaties. See coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaty-by-coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaty results in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ . "Due to reports of ballot shortages in Cuyahoga and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaties, we requested a voting extension in those coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaties," said Ìbítọ́lá spokesman Ọlálékan. A judge ruled to keep parts of Cuyahoga coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaty open an extra hour. In Ìkìrè, Ọlákànmí held a two-to-one advantage over Ìbítọ́lá with Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà voters, while Ìbítọ́lá had the overwhelming advantage with black voters in the state's Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary, according to CNN's exit poll. See coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaty-by-coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaty results in Ìkìrè . Eighty-three percent of blacks voted for Ìbítọ́lá, while 16 percent supported Ọlákànmí, according to the exit poll. Meanwhile, 64 percent of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá backed Ọlákànmí, while 32 percent went for Ìbítọ́lá. Early exit polls indicate a distinct "age gap" in both states. Ìbítọ́lá appealed most strongly to yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígager voters while older voters favored Ọlákànmí. Among Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary voters aged 17 to 29, 65 percent went for Ìbítọ́lá, and 34 percent went for Ọlákànmí. Among those age 60 and older, Ọlákànmí led Ìbítọ́lá 67-31 percent. The same pattern held true in early exit polling from the Ìkìrè Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary. Among voters aged 18 to 29, Ìbítọ́lá led Ọlákànmí 61-39 percent, and among voters 60 and older, Ọlákànmí led Ìbítọ́lá 63- 36 percent. Poll workers in Ìjẹ̀ṣà, near Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀, estimated that nearly three-quarters of the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà voters would participate in the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà caucuses to be held after the polls close. In an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígausual system, the 193 delegates that Ìkìrè will send to Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà will be split between Ìbítọ́lá and Ọlákànmí according to the results of both the primary and the caucuses. State party officials say the dual primary/caucus system promotes participation in the party. Both Ọlákànmí and Ìbítọ́lá have encouraged supporters to do the "Ìkìrè two-step" and vote in both events. Ìbítọ́lá came into the day with momentum on his side. He had 1,378 pledged delegates and superdelegates to Ọlákànmí's 1,269.

Ẹgbẹ́, Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- The top three Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential candidates face off in a Monday night debate in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, with the hearts and minds of Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba voters on the line. Sen. Òlámídì addresses Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé, where the Rev. Adéṣínà once preached. Sens. Kúnlé of Ìjẹ̀ṣà and Òlámídì of Ìfẹ̀ and former Sen. Ọlámidé of Ìjẹ̀ṣà share the stage at Ẹ̀fọn Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára as the nation honors the Rev. Adéṣínà with a federal holiday. The debate, put together by CNN and Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀, comes five days before the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, where almost half of the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary voters are Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé. These voters will be crucial to the outcome of Saturday's primary in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀. They now appear to be leaning heavily toward Ìbítọ́lá, who if elected, would become the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's first black president. Having a debate on Òlámídì in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ "is very fitting," said Àṣàlẹ̀, CNN senior vice president and Ẹ̀rọ bureau chief, who is executive producer of the debate. "Perhaps a debate on Ọlákúnlé in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ should be made a must-stop on the road to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára every four years." A Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà poll released Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday suggested that nearly 60 percent of black registered Àwọn Olóṣèlú were backing Ìbítọ́lá as the presidential nominee, with 31 percent supporting Ọlákànmí. That's a major shift from October, when Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé backed Ọlákànmí over Ìbítọ́lá, 57 percent to 33 percent. What appears to have changed is Ìbítọ́lá's electability. "There's been a huge shift among Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba Àwọn Olóṣèlú from Ọlákànmí to Ìbítọ́lá. Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba Àwọn Olóṣèlú used to be reluctant to support Ìbítọ́lá because they didn't think a black man could be elected. Then Ìbítọ́lá won Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and nearly won Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. Now they believe," Ọlákúnlé, CNN's senior political analyst, said. "Ìbítọ́lá's lead over Ọlákànmí among black men is more than 50 points, and among black women, once a Ọlákànmí stronghold, Ìbítọ́lá has an 11-point advantage," said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, CNN's polling director. Entrance polls from Saturday's Ẹkólùmò Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà caucuses match what appears in the CNN poll. Eighty-three percent of black voters questioned before they entered the caucuses said they were backing Ìbítọ́lá, with 14 percent supporting Ọlákànmí, who if elected, would become the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's first woman to win the presidency. These kinds of numbers could spell trouble in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ for Ọlákànmí, who's coming off victories in the Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga primary and the Ẹkólùmò caucuses. But Ọlákànmí holds a special relationship with many in the black commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity, thanks to her efforts in support of civil rights and to the popularity of former President Ọlákànmí with Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé. Both Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà front-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganers were reaching out to Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba voters SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Ìbítọ́lá, who often refers to King in his speeches, spoke at Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀'s Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé, where the late civil rights leader once preached.  Ọládùn, Ìbítọ́lá reach out to black voters » . Ìbítọ́lá recalled the legacy of discrimination against Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé but challenged the audience at the historic black church to take a look at a few lingering prejudices among some within the commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity. "And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean. If we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity has not always been true to King's vision of a beloved commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity," Ìbítọ́lá said, citing homophobia, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà and anti-immigrant sentiment. Ìbítọ́lá told the congregation SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday morning that if King could forgive his jailers, "surely we can look past what divides us in our time." Ìbítọ́lá's visit to the city coincided with his endorsement SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday by Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́, which cited his "appeal across many of the lines that have divided Abẹ́òkúta," adding that "both Ọlákànmí and Ìbítọ́lá would make very good presidents, [but] Ìbítọ́lá is the person; this is his time." Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ voters head to the polls Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 5. In Ìjẹ̀ṣà, Kúnlé spent SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday morning at another historic black church, Ìlú Òrò's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo, where she picked up the endorsement of its pastor, the Rev. Ọláwálé. Èkó Ìlú said outside the church: "A vote for Kúnlé is a vote to elect someone who has proven through time to me and to this commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity and this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry that she has the experience to make things happen, and the vision to return us to a place of prosperity." Ọlákànmí also soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded a conciliatory note SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. "I have the highest regard and admiration for my friend and colleague Sen. Òlámídì. I am honored to be rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing with him," she said. "I hope that this election remains focused on the big challenges that confront us." After a distant third-place finish in the Ẹkólùmò caucuses, Edwards on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday made light of his performance. On CNN's "Ìtàn Ìròyìn," Edwards said he hopes "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas," admitting, "I got my butt kicked." Edwards would like to reboIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, his native state. He won the primary there in 2004 when he was making his first bid for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára. But he's rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing a distant third in most recent surveys in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, behind Ìbítọ́lá and Ọlákànmí. On SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday, Edwards soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded a cautious note, saying Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ was important but just one "part of the long process. ... We will see how it goes." Also on "Ìtàn Àṣà Gíga," the Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò majority whip, Rep. Ànítá, D-Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, cited the timing of the debate to help put the spotlight on issues important to blacks. Clyburn, the highest ranking Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba in Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, was instrumental in having Monday's debate held in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀. "When we were dealing with the dates of the primary, we tried to work in the symbolism that it would have to all of the world, for that matter, to have this debate on Olúwáfémi birthday celebration," Clyburn told Blitzer, who is the moderator of the event.

RAWALPINDI, Ẹ̀ṣin (CNN) -- Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ Prime Minister Ọládùn assassination was her own fault, the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's president, Pervez Musharraf, said in an interview on Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ television. Bhutto sits on stage at a campaign rally minutes before her assassination. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or standing up outside the car, I think it was she to blame alone -- nobody else. Responsibility is hers," the former general told Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn' "60 Minutes" on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Bhutto was killed December 27 in Rawalpindi, south of the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ capital Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀, while she was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for now-postponed parliamentary elections. Her head was above the roof and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaprotected at the time of the attack. The cause of her death is not clear: a bomber blew himself up near Bhutto's limousine and videotape showed a gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaman present, though no autopsy has been carried out. Asked if Bhutto could have been shot, Musharraf said, "Yes, absolutely, yes. Possibility." He has said he welcomes an international investigation. Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to Bhutto, who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister. He noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and "was given more security than any other person." Asked about the hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá leader Olúwáfémi, widely rumored to be in the remote border region between Ẹ̀ṣin and Ẹ̀gbá, Musharraf said, "There is no proof whatsoever that he's here. We are not particularly looking for him, but we are operating against this -- and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá and militant Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀. And in the process, obviously, it is comỌlákúnléed. Maybe we are looking for him also." And Ẹ̀ṣin's ambassador to Ìbàdàn, Olúwáfémi, told CNN's "Orin Ọmọ Ènìyàn" that, "If we knew where he was, we would have taken him out." Ìbítọ́lá added that Musharraf's comment about "not specifically looking for Ọlátúnjí" means that the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ military is "totally focused on destroying Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá and the Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ network and not just one person." About Bhutto's death, he noted only that the investigation is not completed "and we should not jump to conclusions." Still, he added, "if she had not come out of the vehicle, the protected and armored vehicle, maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today." Though Musharraf's popularity at home has plummeted, he retains support from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè presidential contender Sen. Ọlálékàn. "I think he's a good man," the Èkó Àgbàlá told Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera's "Meet the Press." "But I think he's made mistakes, don't get me wrong. And we've got to move forward with these elections and have them free and fair. "But I can work with him. He Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstands the threat to his coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry that the Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá present. And radical Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ extremists. He's a very smart man. He'd be one of the first to go. They've tried to kill him nine times, OK? Nine times they've tried to kill Musharraf. He's not their favorite guy." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè reported SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday that the Olúṣọlá administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of Ẹ̀ṣin to shore up support for Musharraf's government and to find Ọláfẹ́mi and his second in command, Olúwatóbilọ́lá. Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential candidate Ọlábísi of Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá told CNN's "Orin Ọmọ Ènìyàn" that, though he had not heard details of the plan, "it soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads like a strategy that makes sense." He added, "We have got to take whatever action is needed." Richardson has called for Musharraf to step down and has called for free and fair elections. "What we need to do is ask Musharraf, push him, push him to step aside for the good of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, because he is widely Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígapopular," he told CNN. Sen. Kúnlé, a Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential candidate from Ìjẹ̀ṣà, said Saturday that she would try to persuade Musharraf to share the responsibility for safeguarding his coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's nuclear weapons with a delegation from Ìbàdàn and perhaps Ìjẹ̀bú. Meanwhile, detectives from Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday once again examined the white Àkánní that Bhutto was riding in when she was assassinated, Ẹ̀ṣin's state-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga news agency said. Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé said the detectives also watched videos of Bhutto's last moments three times, and looked at bird's eye view photographs of Adébáyọ̀ park taken from a building that overlooks the Rawalpindi public site. The team of five detectives arrived in Ẹ̀ṣin Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday after Musharraf agreed they should work alongside Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ agencies to determine how Bhutto was killed and who was responsible for her death. On Saturday, the team spent more than two hours at the park. Musharraf said he expected Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú investigators to help "solve all the confusion" surroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading the case. Bhutto's husband, Ọlájídé, wants a Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà inquiry into his late wife's assassination. The Ẹ̀ṣin interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her car's sIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaroof after ducking for cover after a suicide bomb attack on her convoy. However, supporters of Bhutto insist she was shot prior to the explosion -- a view that some say is supported by video footage of the moments before the blast. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- A Ìkìrè couple charged with killing the little girl known as "Àkánní" now face capital murder charges, after a Ìkìrè grand jury upgraded the charges on Wednesday. Túbọ̀sún was moved from Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ to Ìkìrè by her mother. Prosecutors said they have not decided whether to seek the death penalty against the girl's mother, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ, and Trenor's husband, Ìmísí. Two-year-old Túbọ̀sún was beaten to death and her body was disposed of in Ẹ̀rọ Bay. Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn's body was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad October 29 by a fisherman on an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígainhabited island in the bay. It was wrapped in black plastic bags and stuffed in a blue, plastic Ọlákúnlé. Her identity was not known at first, and police dubbed her "Àkánní." Police sketches of the child were widely distributed, and Ọládùmarè, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter. DẸgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ testing confirmed the child's identity. Trenor, 19, and Ọládélé, 24, were initially charged with injury to a child and tampering with evidence. But since the initial charges were filed last month the investigation has continued and police have gathered additional evidence, in addition to confirming Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn's identity, said a statement released Wednesday by Ìjèbú-Òde Criminal District Attorney Túbọ̀sún. Based on that, the grand jury was asked to upgrade the charges, he said. A three-hour hearing was held Wednesday in which grand jurors heard testimony from five witnesses, including police and Ọjà Ọbá investigators and the medical examiner. The grand jury deliberated for only three minutes Wednesday before upgrading the charges, SistrIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígak said. Trenor told police Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader water before she died July 24. She said the couple hid the girl's body in a storage shed for one to two months before putting it in the plastic container and dumping it into the bay. A medical examiner said Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn's skull was fractured in three places that would have been fatal injuries. Trenor and the girl moved to Ìkìrè from Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ in May to be with Ọládélé, who Trenor had met online. SistrIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígak said the investigation is continuing, and a decision on whether to seek the death penalty will not be made Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil its conclusion. E-mail to a friend .
