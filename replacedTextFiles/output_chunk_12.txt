Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ẹ̀sìn's Ọláwálé sent a secret message to President Adéọlá in 1970 pleading with him to attack Èkó Ìlú, according to declassified documents released Wednesday by the former president's library. President Ìmísí works at his desk in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú in a JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae 1972 photograph. The papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the Ìmísí Presidential Library, some of which offer harỌlákúnlégers of present-day events, such as concerns about terrorism and Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. Library director Ìbítọ́lá said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the Àwọn Ìròyìn more involved in solving the Àwọn Yorùbá-Àwọn Hausa conflict, how to get them more engaged against terrorism, how to address the Àwọn Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ulani view that Ìbàdàn always sides with Ọ̀ṣogbo and how to build up moderate Àwọn Ìgbò to coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígater extremists. A 1973 diplomatic cable cites this objective: "isolate and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadermine terrorisms [sic] and commandos [sic] by establishing another, more stable and respectable Àwọn Yorùbá political entity and political personality." Documents detail Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ efforts to persuade Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ to move away from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú, the military wing of Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú, because Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ officials believed the Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde was supporting the terrorist-linked, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú group Ìpàdé Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, referred to as BSO. The document, a Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga telegram from the embassy in Jeddah to Ẹ̀rọ reads, "BSO and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú [are] now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacertainty. One might wonder whether central objective BSO conspiracy was not to erase any slight progress toward Ìlú Ìbàdàn peace." The document release was intended to coincide with Ìlú Ìlọrin peace summit among Àwọn Yorùbá, Àwọn Hausa and other Ìlú Ìlọrin leaders in Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀, Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ said. The Ìmísí Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ also was adjusting to Ọ̀ṣogbo's acquisition of a nuclear weapon. "We are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for Ọlálékan decision in 1969 to accept the fact, a fact of life, that Ọ̀ṣogbo had a bomb, a nuclear device," said Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́. "That, of course, is very important with what's going on in Kúnlé." "Even though it is clear from the documents that Ìbàdàn government did not encourage Ọ̀ṣogbo to acquire a nuclear deterrent, it became a fact of life," Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ said. "There are materials here that show how our government, 30 years ago, dealt with this very, very difficult problem." Rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power, Ọ̀ṣogbo still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability. In 1970, as Ọláwálé dealt with threats by both Àwọn Yorùbá refugees in his coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú military forces crossing Ẹ̀sìn's border, the king asked "Ìbàdàn and Ìjẹ̀bú to intervene in the war in Ẹ̀sìn, asking Ìbàdàn, in fact, to attack Èkó Ìlú," Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ said. "Èkó Ìlú had invaded Ẹ̀sìn and the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀sìn king, facing what he felt was a military rout, said please help us in any way possible." The telegram indicates that Ànítá himself called a Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ official at 3 a.m. to ask for Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ or Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ help. "Situation deteriorating dangerously following Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú massive invasion...," the document said. "I request immediate physical intervention both land and air ... to safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ẹ̀sìn. Immediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative." The library has withheld the Ìmísí documents from public access Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil Wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified, Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ said. Ìmísí served as president from January 20, 1969, to August 9, 1974, when he resigned Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader political pressure during Ìpàdé Àwọn Ará scandal -- the only Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ president to do so. He died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹgbẹ́, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ (CNN) -- The Rev. Àkíntúndé, a civil rights activist whose 1965 jailing sparked a fatal protest that ultimately led to the famed Selma-to-Montgomery march and the Voting Rights Act, died Saturday at Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀'s Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo said in a statement. He was 65. Orange was a native of Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́, "who resided in southwest Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀ for four decades while fighting the good fight for equality and social justice for all mankind," said the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́, a civil rights organization. Orange was arrested and jailed in Ìṣẹ̀dó, Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́, in 1965 on charges of disorderly conduct and contributing to the delinquency of minors for enlisting students to aid in voting rights drives. As rumors spread that Orange would be lynched, civil rights activists organized a march to support him. However, the marchers clashed with Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ state troopers during the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 18 demonstration, and a yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag black man, Ọlákúnlé, was shot in the stomach. "I could hear the singing and the commotion," Orange told CNN last year. "Once the tear gas was flying and the shots started, I couldn't tell what was going on." Ọláfẹ́mi, 26, died eight days later. Witnesses said Ọláfẹ́mi's grandfather, who was active in the voting rights movement, had been beaten by troopers, and Ọláfẹ́mi was trying to get him to the hospital. The anger resulting from Ọláfẹ́mi's death led civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Adéṣínà, to organize the Selma-to-Montgomery, Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́, voting rights march. The first attempt at that march was broken up by club-wielding state troopers and sheriff's deputies, a melee that became known as "Bloody SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday." "Olúwatóbilọ́lá's death is the reason that Bloody SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday took place," Orange said. "Had he not died, there would never have been a Bloody SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday." On the marchers' third attempt, in March, they made it to Montgomery. President Ọlátúndé signed the Voting Rights Act into law in August 1965. In May 2007, a former Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ state trooper, Tèmítọ́pẹ́, now 74, was indicted in Ọláfẹ́mi's shooting, one of several cases involving the deaths of civil rights activists that prosecutors have revived in recent years. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé has claimed he shot Ọláfẹ́mi in self-defense, but Orange and Elijah Rollins, who was upstairs at a nearby cafe when the shooting took place, last year disputed claims that protesters were throwing rocks and bottles at police. "Not one bottle or brick was thrown back at the troopers," said Orange, adding that film and a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa report back that up. He said he was glad Ọláfẹ́mi's case had "never been forgotten." Orange was a project coordinator at the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ from 1965 to 1970, then later became a regional coordinator with Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá in Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ said. Since 1995, he had served as the foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader and general coordinator for the Ọlámidé Committee-Ìlú Ọ̀ṣogbo/Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe Committee, Inc., which coordinated commemorative events honoring King and also promoted industry and commerce among Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìbàdàn and Ẹ̀pẹ̀. Orange is survived by his wife, five children and two grandchildren, the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ said. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaeral arrangements were incomplete Saturday. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn, Ìjèbú-Ìgbo (CNN) -- Supporters and opponents of Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's Àwọn Ìròyìn government appeared to split seats on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday as Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà voters went to the polls to replace two ruling-party lawmakers assassinated in recent months. Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà women wait in line to cast their votes in Ìfẹ̀. Voters in Ìfẹ̀ sent pro-government candidate Àṣàlẹ̀ to parliament to replace Àjànákú, who was killed in a JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae bomỌlákúnlég. Both Eido, a Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn, and Àwọn Kànúri are members of the bloc led by Adébáyọ̀ -- the son of former Prime Minister Ọládàpọ̀, whose 2005 killing triggered Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's current wave of political upheaval. But in Metn, a Àwọn Ìṣàkóso suburb east of the capital, anti-government candidate Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi upset former President Ayọ̀míde by a few hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadred votes, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà television network Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà reported. Ẹ̀tó is a member of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà, the anti-government party led by former Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso Gen. Ọládélé. Ẹ̀bùnọlá has said he will rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga for president of Ìjèbú-Ìgbo -- and since the post is chosen by members of parliament, SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday's results were closely watched. Ọlákànmí was seeking the seat held by his son Ọlálékàn, who served as industry minister in the government of Prime Minister Ọlákúnlé before being gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganed down in his car in November 2006. He served as president from 1982 to 1988, during the civil war in Ìjèbú-Ìgbo. His brother, Ọládùmarè, was elected president in 1982 but was assassinated before he could take office. Eido and Ọlákànmí were among several Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà political figures killed since the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 2005 killing of the elder Hariri. All were critical of Èkó Ìlú's influence in Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, and their supporters blamed Ọ̀yọ́ for their deaths -- allegations the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé and their allies in Ìjèbú-Ìgbo denied. Hariri's killing triggered a wave of protests against Èkó Ìlú known as the "Cedar Revolution," which brought Ọlákúnlé's government to power and forced Èkó Ìlú to withdraw the garrison it kept in Ìjèbú-Ìgbo for three decades.

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- The Ọjà Ọbá asked Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ to investigate whether former operative Ọlátúndé illegally disclosed classified information when he talked about the waterboarding of a terrorism suspect, government officials say. Ex-Ọjà Ọbá agent Ọlátúndé says he Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderwent waterboarding in training and cracked in a few seconds. Ẹkólùmò spoke last week with several news organizations, including CNN, after the Ọjà Ọbá disclosed that videotapes of certain interrogations were destroyed in 2005. That revelation has prompted new calls for investigations on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò. The Olúṣọlá administration appeared in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday to answer a judge's questions about the tapes' destruction. Speaking to CNN last week, Ẹkólùmò said that Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ interrogators drew valuable information from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá captive Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ by "waterboarding" him. But Ẹkólùmò said the procedure amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats to torture and should be stopped. Waterboarding involves pouring a stream of water onto the cellophane-covered face of a suspect to induce the sensation of drowning, Ẹkólùmò said.  Watch how a suspect is waterboarded » . Ẹkólùmò told CNN he was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaaware that Ọjà Ọbá interrogations were being taped, but that the tapes should have been kept "as a matter of historical record." Ẹkólùmò's attorney Olúwáfémi told CNN that the referral of the case to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ is standard procedure. "A criminal referral from the Ọjà Ọbá would be both expected and normal Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the circumstances," Zaid said in a written statement. "It is a routine act that the Ọjà Ọbá Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadertakes even when they know no violation has occurred." Zaid added that the question is whether Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ will proceed, and that such a decision "must be measured carefully." "Doing so will Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalock a Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà's box that will place a spotlight on the information in question as to the lawfulness of the alleged conduct and the activities of those involved." he said. "There would also exist a challenge regarding whether Mr. Ẹkólùmò was being targeted for exercising his Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irst Amendment rights." Ọjà Ọbá officers who leave the agency are required to sign documents promising never to divulge classified information. Written comments are cleared by an agency review board before publication, and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígascripted oral comments -- such as television interviews -- are referred to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ after the fact. About one case a week is referred to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀, and an investigation could take months to complete, a source in the intelligence commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity said. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or private citizens foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad to be in violation of the secrecy standard, penalties can range from loss of security clearances to criminal prosecution leading to jail time. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa spokesman Ṣọlá said the department has no comment on the Ẹkólùmò matter, and routinely refuses comment on whether another agency has referred a case. Ẹkólùmò said he was not present when other agents used the waterboarding technique on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀, but that he was told the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá suspect lasted 30 or 35 seconds. Ẹkólùmò said he himself was subjected to the treatment during his training, and lasted about five seconds before having to stop. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ọládùn contributed to this report.

(LifeWire)  -- Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or some, Ọlábísí's Day can be heavenly. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or others, it's just plain hell. Take Bólánlé, of Lágosì. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀our years ago, she and her live-in boyfriend -- the guy she thought she would marry -- were having a pre-Ọlábísí's Day brIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígach when Túbọ̀sún leaned over and whispered a few sweet nothings in his ear. "I said, 'I'm so happy to know that you're the one for me. Aren't you glad to know I'm the one for you?' " says Túbọ̀sún, 32, who works in marketing. "And there was this silence. And then he was, like, 'I know you're the one for me now. But can you give me Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil summer to make a final decision?' " Aghast at his response, Túbọ̀sún quickly broke things off -- but she couldn't move Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil she foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad a new apartment. Home alone on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 14 in the apartment they shared, she decided to snoop through her ex-boyfriend's e-mail and discovered he'd had contact with several other women while they were together. "I've never been a big fan of the holiday," Túbọ̀sún says. "But now I typically refer to it as Ìpàdé Àṣà..."   Watch whether romance is still alive » . Good times, bad times . Túbọ̀sún isn't alone in dreading Ọlábísí's Day. Thanks to super-sized expectations and over-the-top commercialization, Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 14 has gone from a sentimental aside to a pressure-filled gaIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatlet lined with chocolate boxes, tennis bracelets and cheesy stuffed bears.  See where the love dollars go » . "The holiday's designed to make you feel (bad)," says Dúrójaiyé, author of "How Not to Date." "If you're in a relationship, it's never anything that it's supposed to be. And if you're single, you feel like a big loser because you don't have anybody. I think people should lower Ọlábísí's Day expectations to pretty much nil. That way, anything that happens is good." Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀, a 32-year-old technical writer from Ìjèbú-Òde has seen his Ọlábísí's Day go sideways repeatedly -- most memorably the time he ended up in handcuffs (and not in a good way). "Last year, I was in Ìkìrè and I met this beautiful woman who took me to dÀṣàkẹ́er at this hot, new restaurant,'" he says. "But then she gets food poisoning and ends up in an alley with major gastrointestinal problems. And while I'm standing guard, the cops pull up and think I'm paying her for sex." Wise talked his way out of an arrest (luckily, one of the policemen had eaten at the same place) but he's foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad no release from his Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalucky Ọlábísí's. "It doesn't matter who I'm out with," he says. "The day is just cursed." There are ways, though, to avoid a miserable holiday. Good plans . Most women will admit they like to celebrate, but a fancy night on the town isn't necessary. "Sometimes, hanging out at home can be a lot more fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga than going out to some restaurant filled with couples," says author Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. "Stay home with champagne, caviar and maybe a new toy from a tasteful sex shop." If you're not dating anyone, take some time to indulge yourself (a luxurious bar of chocolate, a pedicure), do something relaxing (take a yoga class or get a massage) or spend time with some of your closest friends. Make sure you're on the same page . And if you do make plans, stick to them. Galen, a 28-year-old secretary from Ìjèbú-Òde, and her boyfriend had made special Ọlábísí's Day plans a month in advance. But on the big night, his buddies showed up and talked him into going out with them instead. "I was dressed to the nines," says Galen, who asked that her last name not be used. "When his friends stopped by, he says, 'Do you mind if I go with them?' I said, 'Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ine, go,' being totally sarcastic, and he picked up his coat and left." Although they talked about it later, Galen said, her boyfriend seemed not to Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand that she was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígahappy with his wanting to ditch her for his buddies. The two later broke up. Breaking a date on Ọlábísí's Day is definitely bad form, but automatically expecting one to happen (a much more common scenario) is also problematic. To avoid a disconnect with your significant other, Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga suggests being honest. Simply expecting your partner to know what you want is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígarealistic. Not-so-good gifts . If you decide to go the gift route, Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga recommends not settling for a cliché like a stuffed animal or a hastily purchased bouquet of flowers. "Listen to what the person talks about," she says. "She may want the new 'Godzilla' game for her Wii. His Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderwear may be riddled with holes." Another thing to avoid, advises Òlámídì, 44, of Ìjèbú-Òde, is the gag gift. A few years ago, Àkánní and a new beau went out to a nice restaurant where they shared dÀṣàkẹ́er, drinks and presents. Àkánní gave her date homemade cookies and a Starbucks gift card. He gave her a beautifully-wrapped box -- of Spam. "He thought it was the best joke ever," says Àkánní. "But it just wasn't thoughtful. If you're going to go with a joke, you need to back it up with something else." E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Attorneys for a "high-value" terror suspect who says he was tortured while being held at secret Ọjà Ọbá prisons have requested that a judge bar the agency from destroying evidence of the alleged torture. One of 14 "high-value" detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Èkó Àgbàlá, alleges he was tortured. The motion, filed by Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé attorneys on behalf of Ẹ̀míọlá -- who is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Èkó Àgbàlá -- is dated November 29. That is a week before Ọjà Ọbá Director Ọlátúnjí acknowledged the agency destroyed videotapes it made in 2002 of interrogations of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá suspects using newly approved "alternative" interrogation techniques. Àkínwùmi -- a native of Ẹ̀ṣin who attended high school in Ẹkólùmọ̀ -- was held for more than three years at the secret Ọjà Ọbá prisons and "subjected to an aggressive Ọjà Ọbá detention and interrogation program notable for its elaborate planning and ruthless application of torture," attorney Òṣìnmákínwá claims in the court documents. Details of Àkínwùmi's torture claims are redacted in the filing -- a whole page is blacked out -- but Àkínwùmi's attorneys say he suffers "severe physical and psychological trauma from which he is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalikely ever to recover fully" as a result of his ordeal. Asked about Àkínwùmi's claims, Ọjà Ọbá spokesman Ìyábọ̀lá told CNN, "Ọjà Ọbá's terrorist interrogation effort has always been small, carefully rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, lawful and highly productive. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ewer than 100 hardened terrorists have gone through the program since it began in 2002, and of those, less than a third required any special methods of questioning. Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ does not conduct or condone torture." Àkínwùmi's attorneys claim he was taken into custody in 2003 and "forcibly disappeared" before his transfer to Guantanamo, "where he remains imprisoned without charge or trial." He filed a legal challenge to his detention in September 2006 and appeared before a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára in April, the court documents said. He was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant, but filed a challenge to that on August 14. He was not allowed to meet with an attorney, however, Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil October, the document said. The Olúṣọlá administration contends Àkínwùmi was an operative working for Ọlábísi, mastermind of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Àkínwùmi researched how to blow up gas stations and poison reservoirs in Ìbàdàn, the administration has said. He is among 14 "high-value" detainees held at Guantanamo. Gutierrez and another Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ attorney, Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú, also released declassified notes of their meetings with Àkínwùmi, saying he has been on hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígager strikes while in Guantanamo, is "painfully thin and pale" and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. In detention, he has been able to commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaicate with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀, an alleged lieutenant for Olúwáfémi, they said in the notes. A government official with knowledge of the destroyed Ọjà Ọbá tapes has said that Zubayda was one of the two Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá suspects whose interrogations were videotaped. While Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadergoing interrogation and torture by the Ọjà Ọbá, "Àkínwùmi admitted anything his interrogators demanded of him, regardless of the truth, in order to end his suffering," the documents said. Without a court order requiring the preservation of evidence, "there is substantial risk that the torture evidence will disappear" and that may affect the challenge to his detention, the attorneys claim. The motion was filed in Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá for Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀. Hayden has said the Ọjà Ọbá stopped videotaping in 2002, while Àkínwùmi was not taken into custody Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil the following year. "The careful, professional and lawful questioning of hardened terrorists has produced thousands of intelligence reports, revealed exceptionally valuable insights on Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró operations and organization, foiled terrorist plots and saved Àṣàkẹ́ocent lives," Bólánlé said. "The information developed by the detention and interrogation program has been irreplaceable, and the program has operated in strict accord with Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ law." E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ (CNN) -- City officials in Ìjẹ̀ṣà have denied Àwọn Aláṣẹ President Àjànákú's request to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center next week, a police spokesman said Wednesday. Àwọn Aláṣẹ President Àjànákú asked to visit groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad zero, but Ìjẹ̀ṣà city officials said no. The controversial, outspoken president wanted to "pay his respects" and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá attacks during his visit to Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, Police Commissioner Ọládélé said, citing Àwọn Aláṣẹ officials. But workers are rebuilding the foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadations of the site, "and it would not be possible for him to go where other people don't go," Kelly told CNN. Àwọn Aláṣẹ officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad zero, police spokesman Òlámídì told CNN. But, he said, "If there were a further request, we'd reject it" because of security fears.  Watch why Ìjẹ̀ṣà said no to Àwọn Aláṣẹ leader » . The Àwọn Aláṣẹ mission to the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára said it had not been told of the decision, but in a statement issued Wednesday evening, it called the rejection "Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ GígafortIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaate." Abẹ́òkúta is ruled by a Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Ayé government hostile to the fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadamentalist Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára. Ọlátúndé's predecessor at the time of the September 11 attacks, Ọlálékan, condemned them, and Ìlọrin cooperated with the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀-led campaign to topple Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ allies in Ẹ̀gbá that followed. Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ and Abẹ́òkúta have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Àwọn Aláṣẹ militants stormed Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà in Ìlọrin and held Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga hostage for 444 days.

More than 2,700 people died in the attack on Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, when Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers. A third jet hit the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò, and a fourth crashed in a Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá field after passengers resisted their hijackers. "It is appalling that President Ọlátúndé, one of the world's leading sponsors of terror, would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad," Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn spokesman Ọlájídé said. Several presidential candidates also condemned the requested visit. Kúnlé, the Ìjẹ̀ṣà senator and Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà front-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganer, called the request "Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaacceptable." Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Ẹ̀gùn Gov. Ọláfẹ́mi, a leading Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso, called it "shockingly audacious."

(CNN) -- A Ọ̀ṣogbo judge Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday handed a legal victory to a former astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival, ruling evidence foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial. Ọládùn, accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival, is set to go on trial in April. Ninth Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Judge Ọlátúnjí ruled that all were Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalawfully obtained. He said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors, most concerning police tactics in their interview of Ọládùn and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car. "In each and every case, this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored," Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ wrote in his opinion. "UnfortIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaately, in this case those protections were not as thoroughly followed as the law demands." Àkínwùmi, 44, is accused of stalking Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ. Túbọ̀sún and using pepper spray against her in a parking lot at Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá International Airport in Ọ̀ṣogbo on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 5. She pleaded not guilty March 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon. Her trial is set for April. If convicted, she would face a sentence of up to life in prison. Her defense attorneys had claimed Àkínwùmi's comments to police and her consent to search her car were made Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader duress. During a hearing held in August, Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ heard testimony from, among others, Àkínwùmi, Shipman and Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá police detective Ọlákúnlé, who interviewed Àkínwùmi after her arrest. Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ said in his ruling that when Àkínwùmi asked Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga if she needed an attorney during the interview, he failed to answer her question in a "simple and straightforward manner." "There was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the Miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights as 'formalities' " during the interview, Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ wrote. On the audiotape of the interview, there was no audible response from Àkínwùmi on whether she Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstood that her statements could be used against her in court, and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police, Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ wrote. "Thus, there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstood these two rights and waived them." Àkínwùmi testified at the August hearing she did not respond to Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga's questions because she was confused, Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ wrote. In addition, he said, Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga used "legally impermissible" statements and techniques, including threats, to get Àkínwùmi's statements and consent. "Well, what you say can change what you're charged with," Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga said at one point. "Right now we're looking at [a] possible life felony of carjacking." In a written statement, an Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court, and referred questions to prosecutors. Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ noted that, although Àkínwùmi was given the opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat, she was "subjected to a barrage of questions" begÀṣàkẹ́ing in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity to sleep or make a phone call. "Defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours," the judge said. Àkínwùmi's consent to search her car, Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ wrote, "followed illegal police activity, such as a prolonged detention, threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent." Prosecutors accuse Àkínwùmi of driving nearly 900 miles from Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode to Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá -- wearing Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following Shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot. Her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers. Shipman told police that after she got into her car, Àkínwùmi feigned distress and knocked on the window. When Shipman cracked it to talk to her, Àkínwùmi sprayed her in the face with pepper spray, Shipman said. Police said Àkínwùmi was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash Ọlákúnlé. Àkínwùmi has said she merely went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga dating Àkínwùmi's former love interest, Ànítá. Ọlábísí, who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps. At the August hearing, Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga testified that when he searched Àkínwùmi's car, he foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad maps showing how to reach the airport, maps of the airport's layout, a buck knife and papers including a letter Àkínwùmi appeared to have written to Ọlábísi's mother. He also testified he foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad used and clean diapers in the car. Police previously said they also foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad a Èkó gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, a steel mallet, a 4-inch knife and rubber tuỌlákúnlég in the vehicle. Àkínwùmi's attorneys in August filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense, saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders. On August 30, Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ granted Àkínwùmi's attorneys' request that her electronic tracking ankle bracelet be removed. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ọlákúnlé contributed to this report.

Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́, Ọ̀ṣogbo (CNN) -- Ìbítọ́lá work has earned her the nickname "Ẹ̀míọlá." Ọládùmarè is a forensic artist whose job is to help identify the dead, often murder victims. She is a forensic artist whose job is to give faces -- and sometimes identities -- back to anonymous murder victims who have been robbed of both. Armed with sculptor's clay, glass eyes, wigs and research, Long creates a face from a human skull. When Ọlákúnlé, Ọ̀ṣogbo, police foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad eight sets of human remains in the woods in March, they turned to her -- anything to help identify the people who were so mercilessly left to rot amid the trees and mud. "[Police] have no other way. They have no fingerprints; they have no flesh. Usually, the last resort is building a face," Long said.  See the "skull lady" at work » . She hopes that when the faces of those killed get printed in newspapers or appear on TV or online, a friend or loved one recognizes them and says, "Gee, we haven't seen so-and-so for a while, and that kind of looks like him." "Then, at least, you have a lead, and then you can get DẸgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ from people. And then [police] have something to go on." Long, 67, has made faces for the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaknown victims of grisly homicides and solved historical mysteries. During her 20-year career, the forensics specialist from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde helped identify the crew of Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe, a Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ submarine sIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígak during Àjọyọ̀ Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà. She also created the first picture of the only explorer to have died on the Lewis and Olúwatóbilọ́lá expedition. When law enforcement asks for Long's assistance, it is almost always on a case that has gone very cold. And that was exactly the case in Ọlákúnlé, where police were desperate for any information on the dead they foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad: eight men killed, their bodies discovered in a wooded area on March 23, 2007.  Watch how bones can give clues to investigators » . There were no witnesses, no leads and little evidence of killings other than the victims' bones. If Long could identify the victims of the crime, it might help to catch a serial killer. But before Long could create any likeness of the victims, she would have to do a lot of work -- hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadreds of hours of it. Long first creates a mold of the skull and uses it to make a plaster replica. She puts eraser tips on points to mark tissue depth. Sculptor's clay fills in for skin and muscle. The faded gumline on the skull's teeth helps Long determine how thick the person's lips were. The victim's hair and eye color requires guesswork and research, Long says. Often while working on cases, she talks to people who lived in the same area as the victim or victims to find out the most common eye color and what hairstyles are in fashion.  See how to decode a face » . She spent two months on the Ọlákúnlé skulls. "I start working, and 15 hours can go by, and I don't get up and move, and you don't realize how much time has gone by, and, well, that's how intense I get," she said. "It's like you get carried away in this life of somebody. I start trying to think of them as being an alive person and doing something and not getting killed." Eventually, publicity about the Ọlákúnlé case would lead people with missing relatives to submit their DẸgbẹ́ Olùkọ́. Testing revealed that two of the men were Adéọlá and Àṣàkẹ́. Both men lived hardscrabble lives and had rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga-ins with police. Both disappeared in 1995. At a news conference last month where Ọlákúnlé police Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaveiled Long's sculptures, investigators said they still need to identify the other six victims if they are to solve the case. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ and Blevins didn't closely mirror Long's sculptures of their faces, but there were some similarities, some facial features that looked liked the two dead men. And that's what police say they want: They hope people with missing relatives will look at every detail of the other six sculptures to see whether they notice any resemblance, no matter how faint. "Going into this, I knew there would be some level of subjectivity in the art part of it, but I think what it does is generate the interest," Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe Detective Olúṣọlá said. "I am just looking for that one little similarity, that one little key that someone could recognize that they could make a call that that is their loved one." Since the news conference, police say, they have received hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadreds of leads. Long's work on the case might be done, but she still has nightmares about the eight men killed. "I hear screaming, and I hear pleading, and I hear all these things which I couldn't imagine," she said. "I can see somebody dragging a body out there, and here he kept taking them to the same area. I think, what in the hell is wrong with this guy?" Six of those killed remain nameless. And police are still trying to find the killer. Authorities urge anyone with more information on the case to call 877-667-1296. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- Àwọn Olóṣèlú zookeepers in Ẹ̀fọn will bottle-feed a four-week-old polar bear and rear it away from its mother after concerns the mother would eat her cub, officials said Thursday. Zookeepers fear the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganamed polar bear cub could be at risk of being eaten. The cub, which doesn't yet have a name, was being cared for at Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé, where it was resting Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader heat lamps and is drinking formula. "It's gaining weight, it's very hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígagry, it drinks a lot of milk," said Ìmísí, a spokeswoman for the city. The zoo annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced Thursday that the cub is female. Wednesday, the zoo said keepers decided to take the cub away from its mother, Vera, because the mother was showing signs of being upset and confused, taking her baby in and out of the animals' enclosure. "We were 100 percent sure that the baby was going to die if we didn't take it away from her," Ẹ̀fọn zoo director Àṣàlẹ̀ told Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà magazine. "This would have been a death verdict for the cub." The zoo confirmed earlier this week that its other female polar bear, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, had eaten her two offspring. The zoo said it feared Vera would do the same, so it took her cub away as a precaution. Since then, the cub is thriving in the care of humans, but Vera seems to miss her cub, Ọlámidé said.  Watch how zoo has faced criticism over polar bears. » . "The mother is a little bit nervous," she said. "She walks aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad and is searching for the baby, but the responsible persons for the zoo say this is normal. It will continue for three or four days. It's a normal situation." The zookeepers are pondering whether to bring another adult bear, possibly the cub's father, Ọjà Àgbẹ̀elix, to the zoo to help Vera overcome her loss, and are seeking another small bear to serve as a companion for the rescued cub, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà reported. The zoo said a keeper entered Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s enclosure Monday and noticed that her two cubs were nowhere to be foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. The zoo said it assumes Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ ate her yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag because she believed the cubs were sick, though zookeepers say the cubs were last seen on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday and appeared in good health. But Ọlámidé told Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà that the separation of the bears was bad for the "principle of wildlife conservation" at the zoo: "Now the cub will not grow up to act in a natural way, just as the mother lacked the experience to bring up a cub." The plight of the cub follows the case last year of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde, a cub rejected by its mother at Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga who became the focus of a media frenzy after animal rights campaigners called for it to be killed, claiming it had become too dependent on humans.

(CNN) -- Pastor Ọláwálé calls it the "highlight of my ministry" -- seeing the parents of the man who shot up his church be embraced by the parents of two teenage sisters who were killed in the attack. A former roommate took this photo of Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ performing in a 2002 Christmas program. "The four of them met and hugged and cried," said Àkánní, the senior pastor at Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, Àkúrẹ́. "It made me evaluate my own life and think, 'Is there anyone I'm not forgiving?'" Àkánní was referring to a meeting on January 3 between Adéṣínà and Àkíntúndé, whose 24-year-old son Adébáyọ̀ carried out the December 9 attack at Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé, and Ọládàpọ̀ and Dúrójaiyé, whose daughters, Ọlátúndé, 18, and Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi, 16, were killed in the rampage. Ẹ̀bùnọlá also was woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded in the shootings.  Learn more about the victims » . The pastor said he invited the Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas to visit the New Life campus after praying over the holidays. The family immediately accepted his invitation and was given a guided "step-by-step" tour of where the rampage took place and shown where their son died. "It was extremely emotional. They wanted to hear the details. I kept telling them I would stop with details, but they wanted to hear them," he told CNN in a phone interview this week. At one point, the parents also met with security guard Ọlálékàn, who shot their son in the leg before he turned his gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga on himself. The parents thanked Assam for her swift action and for helping save more lives, said Òṣìnmákínwá, a Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga family spokeswoman and long-time friend. "They told Assam that they were so deeply sorry she had to do what she did," said Ẹ̀rọ Ìtọ́jú. "There were tears, lots of embraces, prayers." The visit, she said, was "very, very, very important" in the healing process for the Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas as they deal with the loss of their son and the terror he inflicted. Àkánní agreed. "I thought this would be best for the Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas," he said, adding that it touched everyone involved. "I've never seen repentance and forgiveness as profoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad as I did that day." The Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas toured the church with their other son, Ṣọlá, 20, a student at Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá. The Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas met the Works in Àkánní's office. He said he also asked the Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas to share "some of the good memories" of Adébáyọ̀ as a boy. "It put it in context: This kid was raised in an upper middle-class home and had every chance to do well," Àkánní said. "You wonder what went wrong for Adébáyọ̀. They described Adébáyọ̀ as any parent would describe their son." The pastor said he didn't tell many people about the meeting before it happened, fearing it "could have gotten volatile and hostile." "It was risky, but I knew enough about the Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas to know they were mature and good people," he said. On SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday, he began his sermon by telling his congregation about what had transpired just a few days earlier. He was met with loud applause. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ began his assault that day at the Youth With a Mission center in Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá, Àkúrẹ́, killing two people -- Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́, 26, and Adébáyọ̀, 24 -- and woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading two others before he went to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè, about 80 miles away. The Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas visited the mission center December 12 and met with the families of the slain victims, according to Ẹ̀rọ Ìtọ́jú. "The depth of our sorrow and our grief is greater than we could possibly describe," the Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas said in a written statement. "But with thanks to God, these remarkable families and their pastors and churches, healing and reconciliation have begIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga." E-mail to a friend .

SAN DIEGO, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá (CNN) -- More than a dozen Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacontained wildfires raged Monday across Àgbàlá Ọ̀rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, threatening thousands of structures and forcing people to flee homes from Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀ to Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ to Àkínwùmi. This photo taken from space Monday afternoon shows smoke rising from the wildfires in Àgbàlá Ọ̀rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ire officials said more than 265,000 people have been evacuated and nearly 4,900 firefighters are battling the fast-moving blazes, which began over the weekend. By Monday afternoon, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ had reported 13 active wildfires have consumed more than 98,000 acres and destroyed or damaged at least 50 homes and businesses across six coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaties. The winds driving the flames are expected to stay strong, coming out of the northeast, at least through Tuesday, according to CNN meteorologist Ọlátúnjí. "It's a tragic time for Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá," Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá Gov. Olúwáfémi said earlier Monday. He declared a state of emergency in seven coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaties and asked Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá to pull 800 soldiers from patrolling the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú border to help battle the wildfires. Monday evening, Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró asked Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ Defense Secretary Olúwatóbilọ́lá to order delivery of all available Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ (Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀) to help fight the fires.

One person was killed and 18 were reported injured in the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaty, including five firefighters. Local officials said the fire situation had worsened throughout the day, prompting new evacuations. "We have a very dangerous, Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígapredictable situation," said Ìyábọ̀lá, chairman of Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́. "We have some of the highest temperatures, some of the driest landscape conditions and some of the most powerful winds -- all the ingredients for a perfect firestorm." On one cul-de-sac in the Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀ suburb of  Ọlákúnlé, five of six homes burned to the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, leaving flames from gas lines flickering amid the ruins, according to a Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn report.

Residents of four housing areas at the Camp Pendleton Marine base in northern Àkúrẹ́ were put on notice for possible evacuations and told to pack personal belongings as a precautionary measure. Earlier Monday, fixed-wing firefighting aircraft were groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded by the strong winds, officials said, making the jobs of fire crews on the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad even harder. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ires threatened Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ Wild Animal Park on Monday, causing the park to close. Some of the animals, such as endangered condors, are being moved to a safer location, according to zoo spokeswoman Dúrójaiyé. Authorities are asking people to hold off on 911 calls Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaless there is a real emergency, saying clogged cell phone lines are hurting rescue efforts. The largest of the wildfires was the Buckweed blaze north of Ẹkólùmọ̀, which has consumed 27,500 acres and forced the evacuation of 15,000 residents from Lágosì and nearby commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities, according to the state forestry department. About 4,000 structures were threatened, and the fire was moving toward the Ọjà Ìdánilẹ́kọ amusement park. Two fires that erupted Monday morning in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ near Àkínwùmi have destroyed at least 123 structures and charred 1,800 acres, said Kúnlé, a spokeswoman for Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́. Several commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities in the area, including Ìlú Ìjẹ̀bú, Arrowbear and RIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing Springs, were evacuated. And in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀, south of Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso, nearly 1,450 firefighters were battling a blaze that began SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday afternoon and still threatened 900 structures in the area, which is home to many Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé luminaries, the state forestry department said.

"After consultation with Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga we agreed to postpone the Old Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irm fixture on the second of January." Motherwell's game against Àwọn Ọdọ́ on the same day was called off on Saturday night in the hours after Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba, 35, died following his on-field collapse.

His courtroom is a desk plopped down in the middle of a dusty schoolyard in the northern Àwọn Tív village of Ọlátúndé. "It works like any other regular court," Ìbàdàn said. "The only difference is that instead of people going to the court, the court comes to the village." The mobile court is bused into rural areas to hear both criminal and civil complaints as part of an effort to dig the nation's court system out from Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader an enormous backlog of cases. With an estimated 300 million Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaresolved cases languishing in Àwọn Tív courts, one consultant believes, it could take more than 300 years to clear the docket at the current pace. There's one main reason for the backlog: inconvenience. People often have to travel long distances over questionable roads, using slow modes of transportation. "The witnesses -- definitely, they don't show up -- and even the parties -- they don't show up -- and they send their advocate," Ìbàdàn said. "But here, people are closer by, so definitely it makes a difference." With distance no longer a problem, more villagers and their attorneys are coming to hearings. Compared to the traditional legal system, the mobile court claims to be both fast and efficient. Ìbàdàn said he has been able to clear 1,100 cases in just six months time compared to 500 Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the traditional court system. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- President Olúṣọlá's top adviser on homeland security is stepping down after 4½ years on the job, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára said Monday. Ṣọlá served more than four years as homeland security adviser. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn Adviser Ṣọlá turned in her letter of resignation to President Olúṣọlá on November 6 and will be looking for new opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities outside government. "I'm going to just take another job doing 20-hour days, but this time in the private sector," said Townsend, who has spent 25 years working in law enforcement and government. Olúṣọlá praised Townsend's work Monday. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ran has always provided wise coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígasel on how to best protect the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people from the threat of terrorism," Olúṣọlá said in a statement. "We are safer today because of her leadership." Townsend's job, as the president's top adviser on fighting terrorism, involved identifying terrorist groups aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the globe and assessing their threat, and finding ways to track and cut off their fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading. She said that experience should will be useful in the private sector as well. Townsend -- the mother of two, ages 6 and 12 -- said she first will look into public speaking, writing and board work before pursuing opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities in global risk management for a large multinational corporation or financial institution.  Watch how Townsend is planning to use her skills » . She said she's been talking with the president about her planned departure for eight months. Townsend's name had come up during the president's recent search for a new attorney general, but she was not considered. She said not getting the job "had absolutely nothing to do with her decision to leave." She said Olúṣọlá had wanted her to stay on in his administration. "It was a hard decision as I have loved and will cherish my every minute of service," she said in an e-mail. "My family actually advocated that I remain and has always been supportive of my service so this was entirely my decision." Townsend is part of the search committee to find a replacement by the begÀṣàkẹ́ing of next year. The president appoints the senior staff position, and it needs no Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú confirmation.

Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ (CNN) -- Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ faces a $7.86 billion lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of nearly 400 Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde families who say the company should be held responsible for the "torture and murder" of their loved ones. With a map of alleged victims, Olúṣọlá makes his case Wednesday at a Ìjẹ̀ṣà news conference. Attorney Olúṣọlá said his clients are seeking "damages for terrorism, war crimes ... and wrongful death." The plaintiffs are asking for $10 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaitive damages for each of the 393 victims named in the suit. Earlier this year, Chiquita, as part of a plea agreement, admitted that what it called protection payments had been given to Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá, or AUC. AUC was named a terrorist organization by Ìbàdàn in 2002, making it a crime to give them money. The lawsuit alleges Chiquita's interaction with the paramilitary group went further than the payments -- it accuses the company of facilitating shipments of arms to the group. "They conspired with the AUC, aided and abetted them in a far-reaching conspiracy and plan to control every aspect of banana growing, distribution and sale," Reiter said. The attorney said one couple refused to sell their banana farm "for pennies" and were killed by AUC in 2001, and other murder victims had been directed to "sell their bananas only to Chiquita." The families filing the suit will remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals in their home coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, he said. "The principle upon which this lawsuit is brought is that when you put money into the hands of terrorists, when you put gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas into the hands of terrorists, then you are legally responsible for the atrocities, the murders and the tortures that those terrorists commit," Reiter said. Responding to the allegations Wednesday afternoon, the company said, "Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ categorically denies the allegations made by these attorneys. We reiterate that Chiquita and its employees were victims and that the actions taken by the company were always motivated to protect the lives of our employees and their families." Chiquita's director of commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaications, Ànítá, went on to say, "Our company had been forced to make protection payments to safeguard our workforce. It is absolutely Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatrue for anyone to suggest that these payments were made for any other purpose." Mitchell said the company will fight the allegations. "Chiquita has already been the victim of extortion in Èkó. We will not allow ourselves to become extortion victims in Ìbàdàn." In the March plea agreement, Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ agreed to pay a $25 million fine for the payments made by the company's former banana-producing subsidiary in Èkó. During a government investigation, the company admitted to making payments to AUC even after outside coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígasel told the company those payments were illegal and should stop immediately.

(CNN) -- Before dying, 2-year-old Túbọ̀sún was beaten with belts, picked up by her hair, thrown across the room and held Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader water, according to an affidavit from the Ìjèbú-Òde Sheriff's Office. Police believe 2-year-old Túbọ̀sún is "Àkánní." The affidavit says the girl's mother, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ, described to police how her daughter died and was put in a plastic storage box that Trenor and her husband, Ọlábísí, later dumped into a Ẹ̀rọ waterway. Trenor told police Ọládélé tried to commit suicide the weekend before Thanksgiving, and wrote a note that said, "My wife is Àṣàkẹ́ocent of the sins that I committed." The body of the then-Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaidentified toddler was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad on October 29. A fisherman foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn's body stuffed inside a blue storage container that washed up on an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígainhabited island in Ẹ̀rọ's Pápá Ọ̀dọ̀. A medical examiner said the child's skull was fractured, and a forensic dentist estimated her age at 2 to 3 years. Police dubbed the child "Àkánní."  A police artist's sketch of her was widely circulated in the news media and prompted a call to Ẹ̀rọ police from Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn's grandmother in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, who had not seen the girl in months. On Saturday, police arrested Trenor and Ọládélé on charges of injuring a child and tampering with physical evidence, the sheriff's department said. Their bonds were set at $350,000 each. The affidavit, obtained by CNN, says when police interviewed Trenor on November 23, she "gave a volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatary statement on video with her attorney present in which she describes her involvement, with Ọlábísí, in the physical abuse, death and disposal of the remains of her daughter, Túbọ̀sún." Trenor's statement said on July 24, she and Ọládélé both beat the child with leather belts and held her head Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader water in the bathtub. She said Ọládélé picked the girl up by her hair and also threw her across the room, slamming her head into the tile floor. After her daughter died, Trenor's statement said, she and Ọládélé went to a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo that night and bought the Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga container, a shovel, concrete mix, and other supplies. The statement said the box containing the child's body was hidden in a storage shed for "one to two months."  Then, Trenor said, she and Ọládélé carried it to the Ẹ̀rọ Causeway and tossed it in, and she saw it drifting away. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi father, Ọláwálé, on Monday tearfully remembered her as a "fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga-loving girl ... with a big imagination."  Bólánlé father describe the little girl » . Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn was "very active, very hyper, but also very well-behaved," Sawyers told reporters in Mentor, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. She would play "with a water hose ... spraying the whole patio soaking wet Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil she was done with it," he said, as he sat behind two photographs of his daughter, a toddler with Ìbítọ́lá. Àkíntúndé mother, Ọládùmarè, said the family was "devastated" to learn that police believe Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn is dead. "It's hard to think that I'll never see her again," she said, clutching a red Elmo doll she had planned to give Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn for Christmas. Maj. Adéọlá of the Ìjèbú-Òde Sheriff's Department said Monday that authorities are "fairly confident" that the toddler whose body was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad on October 29 is Túbọ̀sún. DẸgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ analysis is still in progress to confirm the identification. The results will be available in two to three weeks, Tuttoilmondo said. Tuttoilmondo said Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn is originally from Mentor, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, a Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀ suburb, and that "she and her mother came down to Ìkìrè earlier this year." The toddler was last seen in Ìkìrè "three or four months ago," Tuttoilmondo said, although he did not know by whom. Tuttoilmondo said police did investigate whether Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera had taken Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn away, something the mother had reportedly alleged. Of that report, Tuttoilmondo said, "What we believe is that is not what happened." The affidavit said Trenor admitted that after the body was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, Ọládélé had her type up a fake letter from Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ saying that Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn was to be taken away. Trenor left Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ in late May, after filing an allegation of domestic violence against Ọláwálé and reaching a joint volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatary agreement that gave her custody of Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn and gave Ọláwálé visitation rights, the Sawyers' family lawyer said Monday. "She disappeared," Ọlábísi said Monday at the Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ news conference with the Sawyers. Ọládùmarè said Monday that she saw widely distributed police sketches of "Àkánní" and contacted Ẹ̀rọ police in November. The girl in the police sketches strongly resembles photos of Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn. "No, I never did think it would end up like this," Ọládùmarè said Monday, eyes welling. "I guess knowing is better than not knowing." The girl's family in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ has been "very helpful" in this case, Tuttoilmondo said, adding that the Ọjà Ọbá and a Ìjèbú-Òde police officer visited the family in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ said Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn was the product of a "teenage pregnancy." Trenor and Ọláwálé were together for two years as a result of the pregnancy, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ said, during which time they lived with Ọládùmarè. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ said Monday that the family, whose grief she described as "simply overwhelming," wants Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn's body returned to Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ for a memorial service. "What Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn needs is to be brought home," she said. "I think this family needs some closure." Tuttoilmondo asked anyone who knew the child or her family to help detectives reconstruct the events of Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn's short life. The toddler's case has touched even hardened police officers, he said. "Any way you look at it, we carry a piece of her with us, and we'll always carry a little piece of her with us," he said Monday. He held up a small, pink-and-white shoe identical to those the child was wearing when she was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad.  "That says it all. A little-bitty shoe." E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ (CNN) -- Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa on Saturday expanded a recall of groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad beef from about 300,000  poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads to 21.7 million poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads, one of the largest meat recalls in Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ history. The recalled products are all groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad beef patties with various brand names. In a statement, the Ọlákànmí, Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá, company said the hamburger patties may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhea and cramps, as well as other complications.

Tuesday, the company annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced a recall of about 331,000 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads of hamburger meat, according to the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn. "Because the health and safety of our consumers is our top priority, we are taking these expansive measures," said Vice President of Operations Àṣàkẹ́ in the statement. "Topps is continuing to work with the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn, state departments of health, retailers and distributors to ensure the safety of our consumers. Additionally, we have augmented our internal quality control procedures with microbiologists and food safety experts. We sincerely regret any inconvenience and concerns this may cause our consumers," Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò said. This is the company's first recall in its 65 years of business, the statement said. Consumers who find the products at home are asked to cut off the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ code and return it to Topps for a full refIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, then dispose of the product immediately, Topps spokeswoman Ọlálékàn said. The company said to avoid E. coli, consumers should wash hands thoroughly after handling the beef. Topps set up a toll-free recall help line at (888) 734-0451. Ọlákúnlé said because the products may have been produced up to a year ago, many of them have already been safely consumed. Production in the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad beef area of the company's plant in Ọlákànmí has been shut down Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil all the investigations are complete, Ọlákúnlé said in a phone interview. "We're working with the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn and the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ [Ọjà Ọbá] and conducting our own investigation," she added. The products, all groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad beef patties and hamburgers with various brand names, were distributed mainly in the northeastern Èkó Ìjọba, but went to retailers in many other areas of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry as well, Ọlákúnlé said. While the sheer size of the recall is large, two other companies have been involved in larger recalls. In 2002, Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́'s Pride recalled more than 27 million poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads of poultry, and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà recalled 25 million poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads of groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad beef in 1997.

Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá (CNN) -- A boy playing with matches started a Àgbàlá Ọ̀rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga wildfire that scorched more than 38,000 acres, Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga said Tuesday.

As of Tuesday, 18 of 23 wildfires in Àgbàlá Ọ̀rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga were completely Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader control, and the remainder were at least 70 percent contained, according to Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀. The fires are blamed for 14 deaths and charred more than 508,000 acres, destroying about 1,600 homes. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ive people were arrested in arson probes last week, and Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá Gov.
