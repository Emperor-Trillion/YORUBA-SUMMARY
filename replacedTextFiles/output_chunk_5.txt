(CNN)  -- One Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ soldier, three civilians and Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ militants were killed early Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday during heavy fighting in southern Ẹ̀gbá, according to information from Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò officials. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀our Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ troops have now died in the conflict in Ẹ̀gbá. The incident occurred in Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in Uruzgan province, where Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ militants killed an Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ commando, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú said. The 26-year-old commando -- Pvt. Àṣàlẹ̀ of Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ -- served with Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. This is the fourth Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ troop to die in the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà conflict. "The action in which Private Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi died only concluded in the last few hours and was characterized by heavy, close quarter fighting. The SOTG was conducting an operation to clear an identified Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ bomb making facility in Uruzgan province, when the soldier was hit by small arms fire," Chief of Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode said. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò's International Security Assistance Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orce said "a significant number of Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ insurgents were killed or captured as part of the operation. Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ insurgents initiated the firefight which lasted several hours." Gen. Ṣọlá, Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn spokesman, said it is not known how the civilians, two women and a child, died. "However, we do know that the insurgents fired upon Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn soldiers from the compoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad in which the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà civilians (two women and one child) were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad after the fight. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn makes all effort to prevent losses of Àṣàkẹ́ocent civilian lives."  E-mail to a friend .

Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- An 18-year-old authorities say shot eight people inside his high school in southern Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, before turning the gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga on himself, has died, police said. An image from a video posted on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà by "Àwọn Ìròyìn89." The shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on Internet file-sharing site Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà. At a news conference this afternoon, police confirmed the dead numbered two girls, five boys and the school's headmistress at Adébáyọ̀ in Tuusula, a quiet town aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode. Ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The shooter, whom police identified as Ànítá, died at Toolo Hospital, authorities said. Police said he took his own life. It was the first school shooting in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ since 1989, when a 14-year-old student shot and killed two others in the coastal town of Rauma, the Àwọn Ìpínlẹ̀ news agency Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà reported. Police said Olúwáfémi is from Tuusula and who acted alone. He had no previous criminal record and had never threatened anyone from the school before, they added. Olúwáfémi published a manifesto online demanding war on the "weak-minded masses" and pledged to die for his cause.  Túbọ̀sún fire weapons in video from his Web page » . Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat, many of them featuring Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba imagery, shortly after the incident. Àwọn Ìpínlẹ̀ media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the Web site, warning of a bloodbath at the school. A video posted earlier Wednesday, by "Àwọn Ìròyìn89," was titled "Ọlátúndé." "Àwọn Ìròyìn89" identified himself as Olúwáfémi, and said he chose the name "Àwọn Ìròyìn" because it means "storm spirit" in Àwọn Olóṣèlú. The video showed a picture of the school, which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Olúwáfémi against a red backgroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, pointing a gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga at the screen. The clip is accompanied by the song "Olúṣọlá" from rock band Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá. Ọlálékan and Òṣìnmákínwá, the students behind the 1999 Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú massacre, also cited that group's lyrics. Another short video clip, called "Just Testing My GIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga," showed Olúwáfémi loading and cocking a handgIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area; the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit, and then a full-screen shot of him again. He waved at the camera and then walked out of view. The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing. As well as video footage of the Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in Ìbàdàn, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Èkó, and bombs falling on Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ during the 2003 invasion. Many showed victims being wheeled away or people rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing for their lives. Throughout all of this, the single word "DIE" constantly flashed across the screen. Other video clips included Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba-war-criminal footage. In the rambling text posted on the site, Olúwáfémi said that he is "a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Àkánníist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. "I am prepared to fight and die for my cause," he wrote. "I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígafit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection." The police said at this afternoon's press conference that they had been fired at when they arrived at the school at 11.45 p.m. local time (9.45 a.m. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀). They described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape. When the police's special SWAT Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígait entered the high school they foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaman Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígashot woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad to his head. Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him.  Several bodies were also foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, they added. They could not confirm comments by some students that Olúwáfémi was firing through doors. Police also said that the gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Olúwáfémi used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19. The legal age limit to own a gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ is 18, which Olúwáfémi passed in JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae of this year. He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, police added, and practised sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range. Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, which enjoys a strong tradition of hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígating, has a high proportion of gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga ownership, with two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde reported comments from Ọlátúnjí, one of the school's teachers, on radio station Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú. Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ described how the headmistress used the public address system aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad noon to tell pupils to stay in classrooms. He said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news. "After that I saw the gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaman rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing with what appeared to be a small-caliber handgIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in his hand through the doors towards me, after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction, " Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ said. The agency reported Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ as saying that he saw a woman's body as he fled the school, before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows.  E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀gùn, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ -- Ìjèbú-Òde coach Ọláwálé has again omitted striker Ọlálékàn from his squad for this month's friendly against Abẹ́òkúta and the Euro 2008 qualifier against the Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá. Happier times: Ọlálékàn celebrates after scoring for Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn against Torino. Trezeguet has scored scored 10 goals in 11 Serie A matches for Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn this season -- including two hat-tricks -- but has failed to win his way back into the 24-man party. The 29-year-old, who last played for Ìjèbú-Òde in the 1-0 home defeat by Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà in September, was furious after being dropped for the games against Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ and Ẹ̀gbá. He played no part as Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀'s team overtook the Scots at the top of Group B with comfortable victories last month. The coach said: "Ọládàpọ̀ is having a great start to the season with Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn, but he's in competition for a place. If we qualify, the Euro 2008 will be in eight months. A lot of things can happen in between. "I hope Ọládàpọ̀ will help Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn win the Àwọn Ẹ̀dó league title and that he will be at the Euro 2008 with us, and that he will find his form again for Ìjèbú-Òde." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ has again included yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag Lyon forward Tèmítọ́pẹ́, who made his debut as a substitute against the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀aroes and scored the final goal in a 6-0 victory. Ọláfẹ́mi is joined in the squad by club-mate Ẹ̀míọlá, while Ọlátúndé's Ọlámidé is also among the forwards named despite still recovering from an injury. Captain Ọlákúnlé is ruled out due to injury, but the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ midfielder will join up with the squad anyway. "A player of Bólánlé's dimension is going to be missed, but we just have to accept it and get on with it. Dúrójaiyé should be coming to see us because he's a leader, and he's the captain," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ added. Ìjèbú-Òde face the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀kọ́ on November 16 and then travel to the Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá on November 21. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀'s team will qualify for the finals if Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ beat Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà at Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá on November 17. If the Ìmísí game ends in a draw, Ìjèbú-Òde will need at least a point in Kiev to book their ticket. Ìjèbú-Òde squad: Goalkeepers: M Landreau (Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ St Germain), S Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rey (Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga), Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ (Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá). Defenders: E Abidal (Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, P Evra (Àṣàkẹ́), Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ (Arsenal), Àjànákú), L Thuram (Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀), S Squillaci (Lyon), Ẹ̀rọ Ìrántí (Lyon).

(CNN) -- Àwọn Ìṣàkóso sect leader Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial, according to court documents Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígasealed by a Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ judge on Tuesday. Sect leader Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi arrives in court to hear the verdict against him September 25 in St. George, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. Jeffs, the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member Àṣàkẹ́ of Àkíntúndé of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats of being an accomplice to rape. The documents, released by Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ifth District Judge Àjànákú at the request of the media, also indicate that Jeffs confessed to "immorality" with a "sister" and a daughter more than 30 years ago. Among the documents is a competency report on Jeffs completed in April, in which social worker Ọlátúnjí wrote that throughout the month of January, Jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours. On January 28, the report said, he attempted to hang himself in his cell. In the days following the suicide attempt, while he was on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall. Jail transcripts show that Jeffs' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother, Nephi, in which he said, "I am not the prophet. I never was the prophet, and I have been deceived by the powers of evil ... I ask for everyone's forgiveness." Jeffs also told his brother: "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀arewell forever." The day before that, Jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was "covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when I was yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígager." In the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera, members call adult women "sister," and Jeffs' meaning was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaclear. Jeffs' defense attorneys, who argued against the release of the documents, said in a motion opposing the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígasealing of the statements that Jeffs recanted them the following month. Defense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made. They presented Shumate with a letter from another Jeffs attorney, arguing that the statements' release could influence an Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ jury when Jeffs stands trial in that state. Jeffs, 51, was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced November 20. The Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, and Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. Jeffs, a former school headmaster, is the son of the sect's previous president and "prophet," Ọlálékan, who died in 2002. Jeffs was on the Ọjà Ọbá's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in August 2006 outside Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, Ẹkólùmò. Critics say that inside the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera, marriages are arranged for girls as yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag as 13, and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag men. If male followers are excommIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaicated, critics claim, wives and children can be reassigned. During Jeffs' trial, defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting Jeffs because of his religious beliefs, including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven. If Jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera, it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect. However, two of his followers who spoke to CNN -- although Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements. "He is a perfectly priestly man," said a woman who identified herself as Cathy. "He is a man of God, and we will always love him. Once a prophet, always a prophet." Her husband, Bólánlé, told CNN, "It's hogwash. I don't believe it ... I will always consider him my prophet." E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ẹ̀bùnọlá contributed to this report.

SHANGHAI, Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ -- Championship leader Àkíntúndé spIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga out of Àjọyọ̀ Ẹ̀kọ́ to send the world title race to a cliffhanger finale in Ẹ̀rọ on October 21. A disconsolate Àkíntúndé leaves his car after spÀṣàkẹ́ing into the gravel trap in Ìkìrè. Ọlálékàn can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race, but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ team-mate Ọláfẹ́mi in Ìkìrè. The Spaniard finished second behind Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́'s Tèmítọ́pẹ́, who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of Adéọlá. The yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag Àkánní started the race in pole position and at one stage led Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions. However, the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires, which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára take the lead. And when Adéọlá -- who won in Ẹ̀ṣin last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane, he spIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go. Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára and Adéṣínà both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps, with the Ọládàpọ̀ going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both Adéọlá and Adéṣínà. Raikkone's team-mate Ọlátúndé was third, while fourth place was claimed by Àṣàlẹ̀ Sebastien Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn, who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in Ẹ̀ṣin behind the safety car while Adéọlá was cleared of any wrongdoing. Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s Ọlábísí was fifth in a Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà ahead of Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn's team-mate Ọlákúnlé, while Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's Ọlábísi was seventh for Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà and Òlámídì of Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà took the final point for Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀. Adéọlá was still confident he could boIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígace back after suffering his first retirement of the season. "I'm sorry for the team but I can still do it, don't worry," he said. "When I got out of the car I was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year, and to do it on the way into the pits was not something I usually do. "You cannot go through life without making mistakes. But I am over it and we look forward to Ẹ̀rọ. The team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there, and we still have points in the bag. "We were having a great race and we didn't know if it was going to rain or not. The tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderneath. When I came into the pits it was like ice, I couldn't do anything about it." Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ boss Ọlátúndé refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off. "It's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this. It has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another Grand Prix," Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé said. "I don't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did Lewis. But the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance. That's what made the difference. "It was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier, but would it have made a difference? All the top teams -- Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire." Adéṣínà, who qualified for the race in fourth, is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles. "The result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure," he said. "I think the championship will still be very difficult because I know it will not be easy to take four points from Lewis. "I need something dramatic if I want to win. With a normal race it will be impossible." Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára added: "We are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race. "Hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend. It is not just up to us though, we saw today that anything can happen, but we are back in the championship."  E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- This week Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba speaks to the man charged with boosting growth in Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga: Sheikh Ọlákẹ́mi. Sheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Abẹ́òkúta  is deterring potential investors . As chief executive of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò, one of Ọláwálé main tasks is to ensure Ìjẹ̀bú stays ahead of its competitors. The government's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀'s dependence on oil. But with crude prices near $100 a barrel, Ìmísí asked whether the appetite for change had diminished. SM: The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity, so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to. And therefore, because of this aspirational aspect, trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we don't want to go. Òlámídì: How do you redefine Ìjẹ̀bú's role? Traditionally it's been a financial center, but you have Ẹ̀tó, Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, Èkó Àgbàlá even Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà emerging in financial services. How you redefine it to sustain a lead? SM: The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing, financial services are growing throughout the region. Ìjẹ̀bú's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Ìjẹ̀bú. Òlámídì: Strategically and a geopolitical question here: the Bólánlé came out and declared what Abẹ́òkúta's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy, and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Abẹ́òkúta to the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. What's the motivation here? SM: We feel that the distraction caused by the Àwọn Aláṣẹ nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat of the region. Nobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this. Òlámídì: Historically, Abẹ́òkúta has even made claims against Ìjẹ̀bú, what do you do now moving forward now? Do you bring Ẹ̀rọ, Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìbàdàn and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo closer together, in terms of where we should be going in the future? SM: We've resolved our historical issue with Abẹ́òkúta, and we are well beyond that, but going forward... This is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved because it does affect everybody. Òlámídì: Can the Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso (Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára) become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward? SM: Absolutely, I mean, the Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso is speaking with a Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaified voice. Ẹ̀gùn came out with a proposal for providing nuclear fuel from an independent authority; this was completely backed from the Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso. We are all moving forward and are willing to play a beneficial role to resolve this issue. Meet the Sheikh: . Sheikh Ọlákẹ́mi is chief executive of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò, the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Ìjẹ̀búi economy. He was appointed in JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Ọlákúnlé, Bólánlé, Commander-in-Chief of Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà and Chairman of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Bólánlé's office. In 1999, he was appointed head of the court and also deputy head of the Bólánlé's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè. During this time, Sheikh Mohammed was heavily involved with the Bólánlé's initiatives to liberalize the telecommIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaications sector and with labor market and economic reforms. A keen motor sports enthusiast, Sheikh Mohammed was deputy board chairman of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa and is a former vice president of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ, now known as Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe. Sheikh Mohammed, who is married with two sons and one daughter, was born on April 14, 1969. In 1992, he received a bachelor's degree in economic theory from Ọjà Ọbá, Ẹ̀pẹ̀. Two years later, he received a post-graduate diploma in business studies from Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé. (source: Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde) E-mail to a friend .

ALGIERS, Ẹgbẹ́ (CNN) -- Rescuers are sifting through the rubble of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ headquarters in Algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building's facade and leveled nearby Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára offices. Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building. It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. The death toll is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaclear: the official government coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ said 45 people were reported killed. Àwọn Kànúri Interior Minister Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ blamed a militant Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ group with ties to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Ẹgbẹ́'s Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo. In a posting on an Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn Web site, the group Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò claimed responsibility. CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá and other militant groups. In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ẹ̀míọlá and Olúwatóbilọ́lá. It said two trucks were filled with "no less than 800 kg (1,763 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads) of explosives." The group called the operation "another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ nation and in defiance to the Ẹ̀rọ Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ídíò and their agents, the slaves of Abẹ́òkúta and the sons of Ìjèbú-Òde." At least 10 Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára staffers were among those killed, according to Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára spokeswoman Ìyábọ̀lá. The offices of the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. "Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò spokesman Ẹ̀míọlá said from its Ẹ̀rọ headquarters. Watch his full interview . He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára workers. "It's a very serious situation still with the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára in Algiers," he said. In a strongly worded statement, Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára Secretary-General Ọládùmarè condemned what he called "an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára banner." "The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment -- by Àwọn Kànúri authorities and the international commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity," Ban said in the written statement. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bomỌlákúnlég near Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ -- which oversees elections -- and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo in the Algiers neighborhood of Ọládùn, according to the state-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. "I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga away from the car," he said. Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ said the attack was the work of Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people. That group also uses the name Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò after merging with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabỌlákúnlég blasts after it joined with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá. Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú Correspondent Olúwáfémi said the merger comỌlákúnléed the expertise of Àwọn Kànúri guerrillas with the operational ability of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá in Ọ̀ṣogbo, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers. She said the group's goal is to destabilize coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries like Ẹgbẹ́, Abẹ́òkúta and Ẹ̀ṣin, which it sees as enemies of the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ state. Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Ẹgbẹ́'s Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo were on a list of GSPC targets. Ẹgbẹ́, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígarest. Although the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence.

MADRID, Àkúrẹ́ -- Ọlákànmí scored for the sixth game in a row as Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ defeated big-spending Túbọ̀sún to stay in touch with Ṣọlá leaders Real Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀. Ọlákúnlé (left) is congratulated by Adéṣínàaldinho after scoring again in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s 3-0 win over Adéọlá. Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ had thumped Òṣìnmákínwá on their own groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad last season and the visitors were out for revenge -- but conceded twice in four minutes. After 15 minutes, Àwọn Ẹ̀dó goalkeeper Ìmísí let a routine Ọlákúnlé cross slip out of his hands and Àjànákú rolled home into the empty net. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀our minutes later Ọlákúnlé played a great one-two with Adéṣínàaldinho and rifled a shot past Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ for his sixth goal of the season and Xavi added a third late on. "It was a deserved victory against a rival that we have had problems with in the past," explained Barca coach Dúrójaiyé. "We scored twice in quick succession and then we controlled the match using aggression and with the team attacking and defending as a Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígait." "Conceding two early goals inside four minutes is not easy to turn aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad especially against Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀," admitted Ọládùmarè coach Kúnlé. It was Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s fourth straight league win but they still trail Real Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ by two points after the champions beat Recreativo Ìbítọ́lá. Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà international Ọlákànmí, the league's top-scorer last season, scored on 72 minutes before Ọládùmarè netted in the final minute to keep Real at the summit. Tèmítọ́pẹ́ck deserted them when Ọlámidé hit the post but Ayọ̀míde scored in the final quarter hour before Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà struck to keep them two points clear at the top. Real have made their best start since 1991 but coach Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga rotation policy has been questioned with the Àwọn Olóṣèlú chopping and changing his team. "It was an important victory because it is the final match before we go away on international duty," said Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà winger Olúṣọlá. "We are now top for the next two weeks and can build on that when we return." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́rreal, now four points behind Real, lost for only the second time in 15 matches with a 3-2 reverse against Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé. Sevilla, third last season, are in a crisis after losing their fourth league game in a row with a goal from Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga handing Ọlákúnlé a surprise 1-0 win. Sevilla have just six points from their first six matches and are 13 points behind Real. Levante's Ọládélé became the first Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn league coach to be sacked this season, after their 3-0 home loss to Real Zaragoza. . The 47-year-old Èkó Àgbàlá, a former goalkeeper at Adéọlá, joined Levante in January as a replacement for Adébáyọ̀. The Ẹ̀míọlá-based club are bottom of the table with only a point from seven matches. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀gùn, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- There are some circuits that are cornerstones of the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormula 1 calendar: the Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ and Silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers. Then there are the newer circuits -- Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ìjẹ̀bú, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view. Next week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ team put in a single lap. The Ẹ̀ṣin Grand Prix is to return to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, a circuit that hasn't seen an Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout). The Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà in Ẹ̀ṣin and Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Ọ̀pá-Ìkòyí, Ẹ̀ṣin's tallest moIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies. The Ànítá track -- which had held Àwọn Èdá Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Àwọn Èdá Grand Prix will be held at Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji. However an annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacement by Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn (Ọjà Àgbẹ̀OM) this month revealed that Ànítá will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Àwọn Èdá Grand Prix alternating yearly between Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji and Ànítá after that. Behind the scenes is a political battlegroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ connections -- Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà owns Ànítá, Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ owns Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ is a relative newcomer to Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ but, having this year surpassed Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout. The redesign of the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a Àwọn Olóṣèlú architect redesigned a number of Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀, Ẹkólùmọ̀, Ìjẹ̀bú and Ìkìrè, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Ìkìrè and Ẹ̀míọlá. So how do Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ teams prepare for a new circuit such as Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation. Computer-aided design (Ọjà Ọbá) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an oIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígace of dirt is shifted on the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad itself. Despite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji Speedway for some time. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú simulation experts received Ọjà Ọbá data from the Àwọn Èdá race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum. The circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance). Then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car. "In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance," says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ Team. Àkínwùmi, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ explains: . "You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions. "Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried." One peculiarity of the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends. "You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip," says Bólánlé, "and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed." The testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities: . "Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values," says Rampf. Not that everything can be predicted: "I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race," continues Bólánlé. "Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy." E-mail to a friend .

NYON, Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀ -- Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà have been fined $50,800 by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ Ọ̀ṣogbo has been banned for two matches after the incident which saw a pitch-invading supporter approach the Àwọn Ìjọba goalkeeper in last week's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba match at Ọ̀dọ̀-Àpá. Ọ̀ṣogbo's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe suspending him for two matches. The incident occurred when the Àwọn Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ side beat Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ in Ìmísí. A fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute, soon after the home side scored their wÀṣàkẹ́ing goal, and made what appeared to be minimal contact with Ọ̀ṣogbo. The Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced. Ọ̀ṣogbo's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà may choose not to complain about their own pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment, with half of their fine suspended for two years. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe did have the power to change the result of the match, although that was always Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalikely. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe's control and disciplinary body foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà guilty of charges of "lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters", while Ọ̀ṣogbo was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad to have breached Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe's "principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship". Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ have pledged to appeal against the pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment, which as it stands means he will miss the club's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba games against Kúnlé. "It's a suspension that is absolutely excessive," said Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ lawyer Àkíntúndé. "It seems to us a very, very Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígabalanced sentence. It turns Ọ̀ṣogbo into the protagonist of the incident, whereas the protagonist was someone else, and that's not right from a logical point of view." Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà acted swiftly to pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaish the 27-year-old supporter, who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month. The club banned the fan for life from all their matches, home and away. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà chief executive Ọlákànmí said: "As a club we feel this penalty is proportionate to the incident in question and a fair outcome." E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe is blasting Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaional Àwọn Olóṣèlú for not sending a bill that would fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad veterans' care programs to the president's desk by Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba Day. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ọlákànmí accused Àwọn Olóṣèlú of holding veterans care fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading hostage. "There's absolutely no reason that the veterans' bill could not have been signed by the president today, except for the political games that the Àwọn Olóṣèlú decided to play with it," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ press secretary Ọlákànmí said SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday in Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá, Ìkìrè. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaional Àwọn Olóṣèlú had attached legislation fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education. Àwọn Olóṣèlú also added $3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs. The labor-health-education bill would increase fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading by more than $10 billion over last year's fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading attached, but the Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú later voted to strip out the veterans fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading and send the health-labor-education bill to the president. Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀ accused the Àwọn Olóṣèlú of "trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes." "The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the veterans," Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀ said. On Saturday, the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà congressional leadership sent a letter to President Olúṣọlá saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending, sayings disagreements over fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading levels "have never been so great that we cannot reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people." "Key to this dialogue, however, is some willingness on your part to actually find common groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad," Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò Speaker Ọládùn, D-Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá, and Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú Majority Leader Ọlákúnlé, D-Ẹkólùmò, said in the letter. The leadership said last year's Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, which was still Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso control, had never passed a separate bill fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading veterans programs. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga also sent to the president legislation that would fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14, the leadership said. The current fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading level "is still below the $3.9 billion extra that we passed," said Nadeam Elshami, spokesman Pelosi. "We are committed to getting the extra fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading that the Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga already voted on the president's desk for his signature." The leadership blamed Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso members of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga for stalling the fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill. Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀, though, said the Àwọn Olóṣèlú could still send a separate bill to the president fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading the veterans program that passed both chambers of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. "The Àwọn Olóṣèlú decided not to send the president this bill," Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀ said. "That has to be laid at their feet." E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ìbítọ́lá contributed to this report.

(CNN) -- Muddy but Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígahurt, three Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa students emerged from a cramped cave complex in Òṣìnmákínwá, Ìkìrè, after a day-long search SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. A rescuer at the entrance to Airman's Cave in Òṣìnmákínwá, Ìkìrè, SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Lt. Ọlákẹ́mi, an Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ spokesman, said the students -- two women and one man -- were reported missing early SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday after a trip into Airman's Cave, about four miles south of the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaiversity's campus. They were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad about halfway down the 12,000-foot-long cave, which has few spaces big enough for an adult to stand upright and is explored primarily by experienced spelIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígakers. The students were located shortly before 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), about 30 hours after they entered. Their names were not released SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday night. A friend called 911 to report them missing at 5 a.m. The group had told friends to call 911 if they were not back by midnight SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday, according to Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró. Earlier reports that four students were in the cave were incorrect, Cox said. Authorities did not know SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday evening why the students were in the cave for so long.

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ first lady Ọládùmarè -- in a rare foray into foreign policy -- called on Ìṣẹ̀dó's military jIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígata to "step aside," give up the "terror campaigns" against its people and allow for a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀sìn Ìṣẹ̀dó in a commentary published in Wednesday's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò. Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ first lady Ọládùmarè said the jIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígata "should step aside to make way for a Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaified Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá." "Gen. Ìbítọ́lá and his deputies are a friendless regime," Olúṣọlá said. "They should step aside to make way for a Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaified Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá [Ìṣẹ̀dó] governed by legitimate leaders. "The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition -- there is room for a professional military in a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀sìn Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá," Olúṣọlá said, in keeping with the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ policy of still using Ìṣẹ̀dó's former name. In Wednesday's commentary, Olúṣọlá called on Ìṣẹ̀dó's military leaders to release Òlámídì and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. "Meanwhile, the world watches -- and waits," Olúṣọlá warns. "We know that Gen. Ìbítọ́lá and his deputies have the advantage of violent force. But Ms. Ọlábísí and other opposition leaders have moral legitimacy, the support of the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ people and the support of the world. "The regime's position grows weaker by the day. The generals' choice is clear: The time for a free Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá is now." The humanitarian rights situation in Ìṣẹ̀dó has been a cause for the first lady in the past few months as the crisis there worsened. Ìṣẹ̀dó state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released. The official death toll from Ìṣẹ̀dó's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Ìṣẹ̀dó's Àwọn Kànúri monks. On Tuesday morning, Olúṣọlá received a phone call from Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára Secretary-General Ọládùmarè to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Ìṣẹ̀dó, Àkínwùmi. A representative of the secretary general said the call was a follow-up to a conversation they had weeks ago. Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà met last week with the military jIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígata leadership as well as with Orin Ọdún wÀṣàkẹ́er Ọlábísí, who is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader house arrest in Ìbàdàn. The Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ ambassador to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, Ayọ̀míde, told reporters that Ọládùmarè and her husband's administration believe that there is a "need to start preparing for transition" for Ìṣẹ̀dó. "We believe it is very important that progress be made and prisoners be released and conditions for Òlámídì be improved [so] that she can prepare for participation for negotiations for a transition," he said.

Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀, Ẹ̀ṣin (CNN) -- President Olúṣọlá vetoed a $600 billion spending bill Tuesday, accusing Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà leaders of wasting money and plotting tax increases, then took his budget fight with Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga on the road. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga should cut spending "and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law," President Olúṣọlá said. "The majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility, but so far, it's acting like a teenager with a new credit card," he said in a speech in Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀, Ẹ̀ṣin. The bill -- which Olúṣọlá said was laden with $10 billion in "pork" -- would have fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded the departments of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀, Education, and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú. It also would have fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded projects such as a prison museum, a sailing school and a program to teach Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú.

While polls show Olúṣọlá's popularity remains at near-record lows, Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga ranks even lower as a whole. The president has taken numerous opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities to mock the spending habits of the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the government for the 2008 budget year, which began October 1. The bill Olúṣọlá vetoed Tuesday includes about $150 billion to rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga those departments and more than $450 billion in mandatory spending on Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú, the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor, according to Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé. The committee's chairman, Rep. Àṣàkẹ́, called Olúṣọlá's veto "not responsible and not credible." "This is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 Àwọn Ẹ̀ka," Obey, D-Wisconsin, said in a statement issued after the veto. "There has been virtually no criticism of its contents. It is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics." Olúṣọlá said Àwọn Olóṣèlú are supporting $22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases. "When the bill for all that spending comes due, Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga is going to turn to the working people, to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs," he said. Tuesday's veto is the fifth cast since Àwọn Olóṣèlú took control of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in 2006. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga has overridden one of those, voting last week to authorize $23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president's objections. Àwọn Olóṣèlú will schedule another override vote this week, an aide to Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. But Kúnlé, spokeswoman for Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso Whip Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, said Olúṣọlá's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto. Olúṣọlá signed a $470 billion Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò spending bill that covers Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà normal operations, but Àwọn Olóṣèlú split $50 billion in spending for the wars in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ and Ẹ̀gbá off into a "bridge fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad" to which they plan to attach demands for Olúṣọlá to withdraw Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ combat troops. The measure sets up another confrontation with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára. Olúṣọlá also demanded Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes, but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue. He said a plan proposed by Rep. Ọlájídé, the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà chairman of Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá, to eliminate the tax was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaacceptable. "Preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas," he said. "Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the AMT relief to my desk as soon as possible." The elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $800 billion to be lost over 10 years. To replace that, Ẹ̀míọlá's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $100,000, after deductions, and close corporate tax loopholes. The bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers. Àwọn Ẹ̀ka have already started calling it "the mother of all tax increases." "With all the other pressures on our economy, raising taxes is one of the most Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígawise things Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga could possibly do," Olúṣọlá said. Olúṣọlá acknowledged the difficulties Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga face from high fuel prices, a "challenged" housing market and "Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacertainty" in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- "but as we have seen in recent years, this economy is resilient, and that's important for the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people to Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand."

Ìkìrè, Ìjèbú-Òde -- Ìjèbú-Òde lock Sebastien Èkó has been cited for a dangerous tackle on Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀'s Òṣìnmákínwá during Saturday's Ìpàdé Ọmọde Àgbà semifinal in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. Òṣìnmákínwá offloads despite being tackled by Ọlámidé, left, and Sebastien Èkó. The Ọládélé forward will face a disciplinary hearing on Monday after his tackle on opposite second-rower Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde was noted by citing commissioner Adéọlá. Èkó started the match on the substitutes' bench, but was brought on in the 26th minute to replace the injured Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára during hosts Ìjèbú-Òde's 14-9 defeat. If he is suspended, then Èkó will miss Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday's third and fourth-place play-off match at the Parc des Princes. Meanwhile, Ìjèbú-Òde coach Ọlálékan said that the defeat was tougher to take than Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀'s 24-7 win in the 2003 semifinals. "In 2003, they were better then us. In fact they were better than everyone," said Laporte, who is leaving his role to take up the post of jIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaior sports minister in the Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú government. "They were like the Ẹ̀rọ of this tournament - the favorite, except they went all the way. This time it's harder because yesterday it was 50-50." Meanwhile, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ -- seeking to become the first nation to defend Àpéjọ Ọdún Ìdílé title -- revealed that star kicker Ọládàpọ̀ again had problems with the match balls during the semifinal. The fly-half, who voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Ẹ̀pẹ̀, rejected a ball before kicking a vital three-pointer against Ìjèbú-Òde. "We didn't say it last week but a non-match ball got onto the field in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà which Jonny kicked," director of rugby Adébáyọ̀ said. "He didn't think about it while he was kicking it. "The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they had Àjọyọ̀ Ẹ̀dá Ayé semi-final Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ vs Ìjèbú-Òde' written on them. On match night, Jonny was vigilant when kicking for goal that they were actually match balls he was kicking. "The practice balls lose pressure and shape. The whole issue last week, the organizers accepted all six match balls should be used by both sides on the Thursday before game."  E-mail to a friend .

Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, Àkúrẹ́ -- A Àkúrẹ́ man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $10,000 on a security system, hired a bodyguard for his son's wedding and never leaves home without a .45-caliber handgIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga strapped to his chest. Ọlátúnjí was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Ọlátúnjí for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Àkúrẹ́. Tèmítọ́pẹ́, chairman of Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́, told Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga this year that witness intimidation has become "almost epidemic," according to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Àkúrẹ́'s witness protection program, the witness in the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà case said, "All they told us was maybe we should move." "I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the details." the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN. After Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad on the other end of the line was a gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà himself through the mail. Watch witness describe fear of being targeted » . Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. However, it is likely he'll be released within five years. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. The latest Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Àkúrẹ́ has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Èkó Ìlú spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year. The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness. That figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture. The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection. One possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. "It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses," according to Ọlákúnlé, executive director of Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà. Àkúrẹ́'s witness protection program is a "joke," according to The Rev. Ọláfẹ́mi, foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader and executive director of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ. Kelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. More than a decade ago, a yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag man named Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison. Givens chose to testify. A few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends. That day continues to haIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat Kelly. Bólánlé says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son's murder. Ayọ̀míde was a college graduate who was engaged to be married. He had plans to move east when a Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. Ayọ̀míde and his fiancee were gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganed down while driving along a suburban street in Ọlákúnlé, Àkúrẹ́. The couple, both 22, died instantly. Bólánlé says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ields told CNN, "I asked them what happened. Why weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life? And I was told he never asked for any protection." Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. "I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness," she said. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ield's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Dúrójaiyé personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents. "I felt like the DA's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life," Bólánlé told CNN. District Attorney Ìmísí maintains the program has improved. She says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena, ensuring witnesses are aware of their options. That didn't start, however, Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil two years after Ayọ̀míde was killed. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀gùn, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Previously Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaseen footage of Ọlátúnjí, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Ọlátúnjí and Dodi step into an elevator at Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́. Images taken from a security camera at Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀urther footage shows Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Ọlátúnjí was pregnant when she died in the Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ car crash. Lord Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ Ọláwálé told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed that scientific evidence might be Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaable to demonstrate "one way or the other" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear "intimate" details of her personal life.  Watch footage of Ọlátúnjí's last hours » . Ọlákúnlé told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Ọlátúnjí may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Ọlátúnjí wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear "scene setting" evidence, including Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed's father, Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀, has contended from the start that Ọlátúnjí and his son were murdered because the royal family "could not accept that an Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ọlọ́rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga could eventually be step-father to the future king of Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀," referring to Ọlátúnjí's son Ṣọlá. "I'm hoping for justice," Ọlábísi said outside court. "At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Ọlátúnjí have been murdered by the royal family." Ọlákúnlé told the jury of Ọlátúndé allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. "You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths," Ọlákúnlé said, according to inquest transcripts. "The first three questions are Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died." Ọlátúnjí, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo they were traveling in hit a pillar in Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò tIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganel in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́. Olúwatóbilọ́lá, who was also killed, was drIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígak and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Ẹ̀bùnọlá was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ to see the crash site, along Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígapublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Ọlátúnjí, Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed, Ọlábísí and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Àwọn Ẹ̀ka reacted with surprise and recrimination SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday to blistering criticism of Àjọyọ̀ Ìbílẹ̀ from former coalition commander retired Lt. Gen. Ọlálékàn. Lawmakers lashed back at retired Gen. Ọlálékàn on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday after he criticized the war effort. On Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday, Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called Àjọyọ̀ Ìbílẹ̀ "a nightmare with no end in sight." He said the Olúṣọlá administration, Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ and Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga all share blame. Speaking with military reporters in Ìjẹ̀bú, Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatable. "I'm astoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded, really," Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso Sen. Olúwáfémi on CNN's "Ìtàn Àṣà Gíga" with Ọlákànmí on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Ànítá, who recently returned from Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, said he and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè presidential candidate Sen. Ọlálékàn had visited Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára several times in 2003 and 2004. "Every time we talked to Gen. Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára, we got pushback -- we have enough troops; Guard and reserves aren't being strained," Ànítá said. He added that Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára's own record in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ is blemished: Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi "got out of control Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader his watch. The war in general got out of control Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader his watch." But Ànítá said that "finally," with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ troops since January, "We are getting it right." Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára told reporters that Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ political leaders have cost Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ lives on the battlefield with their "lust for power." Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired. "While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die," he said. That brought a tart response from Àkíntúndé, the ranking Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso on Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn. "I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time," Àkíntúndé told Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn's "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ace the Nation." He said Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but "Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ GígafortIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaately, that doesn't happen very often." One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Chief of Staff Gen. Ọládùmarè, Àkíntúndé said. Ìkìrè was sidelined after telling Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga that hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. Sen. Ìyábọ̀lá, a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso from Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀, told Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́'s "This Week" that Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára is simply wrong. "My definition of wÀṣàkẹ́ing is a stable coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry and an ally in the war on terror," he said. "I think we're making significant progress toward that end." But, he added, "I think the central government in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ has been an embarrassment. They've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for." Ànítá said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi will "step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year." If that does not happen, he said, "it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀." That brought a blistering response from Àkánní, national security adviser Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader President Adéṣínà. "What is this? This is a colony," he said. "That's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígater." Even those Àwọn Tív who were happy to see Túbọ̀sún toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ presence, Olúṣọlá said. Though some coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries are willing to go along with Ìbàdàn, "No one in the world really supports our policy in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀," he said. In his Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday speech, Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára added that the "surge" of Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ troops into Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ represents "a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war." Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú spokeswoman Túbọ̀sún did not address the comment. Instead, she said, "We appreciate his service to the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá said, there's more work to be done but progress is being made in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. And that's what we're focused on now." Gen.

Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀, Ọ̀ṣogbo (CNN) -- The acrimony from the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN/Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè presidential debate Wednesday. The debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. With five weeks to go Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil the first contest of the 2008 nominating season, the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso candidates engaged in a free-for-all, trying to differentiate their views on immigration, Àjọyọ̀ Ìbílẹ̀, abortion, gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga control and even whether they believed every word in the Ìtàn Ọmọde was true. Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà front-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganer Kúnlé, Wednesday night's attacks were laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígached at each other. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Ìjẹ̀ṣà Mayor Ọlákẹ́mi and former Ẹ̀gùn Gov. Ọláfẹ́mi traded jabs over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month. Romney attacked Ayọ̀míde's record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegal immigration. And Ayọ̀míde shot back, accusing Romney of having a "sanctuary mansion" at his own home.  Watch the debate format produce raw moments » . "In his case, there were six sanctuary cities. He did nothing about them. There was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home, illegal immigrants were being employed," Ayọ̀míde said. Romney denied Ayọ̀míde's allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other. In his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Ẹ̀gbá Gov. Ànítá, who has been rising in the polls. Rep. Ẹ̀bùnọlá, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take, saying the other candidates were trying to "out-Tancredo" him. Huckabee drew one of the night's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde. "Most people in this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry are more afraid of an audit than they are of a Ọládùmarèging, and there's a reason why," he said. Sen. Ọlálékàn, freshly back from a visit to Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep. Olúwatóbilọ́lá, the most anti-war of the candidates, tangled on two occasions over Àjọyọ̀ Ìbílẹ̀.  Did  Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú get their questions answered? » . Asked which government programs they would cut, Ọlábísí said bringing the troops home from Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ would save "a trillion dollars." Àkíntúndé said: "It's that kind of isolationism that caused Àpéjọ Ìjọba," which drew some hoots from the crowd.  Ìmísí, Ọlábísí spar on Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ » . Ọlábísí replied: "The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?" A retired brigadier general, Ọládùn, who is gay, asked candidates if they thought Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops. CNN later learned that a JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae media release from the campaign of Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà  front-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganer Ọlákànmí listed Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò as a member of its steering committee for gay and Ọlátúndé.  Àjànákú deny that the Ọlákànmí campaign influenced his question » . Àṣàlẹ̀, CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate, said, "We regret this incident. CNN would not have used the general's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate." Political Ticker . Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Ọlákànmí campaign and was representing no one other than himself. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò also said he is a member of Ọlábísi, a national gay and lesbian Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso grass-roots organization. Prior to the debate, CNN had verified Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò's military backgroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate. In a section of the debate about gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga ownership rights, three of the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè presidential hopefuls said they do not own gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas: Àkíntúndé, Ayọ̀míde and Romney. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá Sen. Ọlákúnlé quipped, "I own a couple of gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas -- but I'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are."  Watch the candidates address gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga control » . The debate turned personal when a viewer, holding the Ìtàn Ọmọde, asked: "Do you believe every word of this book? And I mean specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand." Huckabee, a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera minister, said, "Sure, I believe the Ìtàn Ọmọde is exactly what it is." Ayọ̀míde said he believes the Ìtàn Ọmọde, but not "literally true in every respect." After that, Romney stammered a bit when moderator Ọládàpọ̀ asked him if he believed every word.  Watch the candidates get personal about the Ìtàn Ọmọde » . "Yeah, the Ìtàn Ọmọde is the word of God. ... I might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word, but I read the Ìtàn Ọmọde and I believe the Ìtàn Ọmọde is the word of God," Romney said. When asked about abortion, Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Ẹ̀gùn. "If people in this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry are looking for someone who's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, they're going to have to find somebody else. On abortion, I was wrong," he said. His remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà's campaign, which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs. Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen. Kúnlé. When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal,  Ọlábísí said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government. "We don't need a federal abortion police, that's the last thing we need," Ọlábísí said. He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities. On the issues of taxes, Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà said he'd "never met a tax he liked." "I've got a tax-cut bill on the table. But I don't do pledges to anybody but the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people," he said. His response was met by a "Go, Ọjà Àgbẹ̀red, go!" from a member of the audience. On the issue of trade with Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀, Rep. Túbọ̀sún said Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ is "cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of Ìbàdàn to stop Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀'s cheating. Buy Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job." The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà Web site, just as Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ candidates did in July. The debate was the first time the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. CNN's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the Àwọn Olóṣèlú' debate. E-mail to a friend .
