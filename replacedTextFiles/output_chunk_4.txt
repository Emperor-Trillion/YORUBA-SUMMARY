(CNN) -- Authorities in Ọ̀ṣogbo recently Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacovered a radical Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ terror plot against Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo in the capital, Ìkìrè, prompting the facility to close its doors to the public Monday, Ọ̀ṣogbo and Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ officials told CNN. The Bibi Ọlátúndé, just outside the capital Ìkìrè. As a precaution, Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ also shut its embassy in Ìkìrè to the public on Monday "following security concerns nearby," Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga said. The terror plot was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaraveled after a weekend raid outside Ìkìrè that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà told CNN. Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga spokesman Ọlábísi stressed that the details "are still Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígafolding," and the threat "may or may not be" linked to the Saturday raid. "There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo there," Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Ọ̀ṣogboi army officer who had connections to a radical Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ group seized four assault rifles, a machine gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga and 20 hand grenades from his military Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígait and hid them in the outskirts of Ìkìrè, the ministry spokesman and Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Ìkìrè, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Ọ̀ṣogboi government buildings. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú in Ìkìrè issued a warden message warning Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in Ọ̀ṣogbo to take precautions. "While there is no information at this time that other Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ or Western interests in Ọ̀ṣogbo are being targeted, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo encourages Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security," it said. Ọ̀ṣogbo is a former Àwọn Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ republic that borders Ọ̀dọ̀-Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, and lies just north of Abẹ́òkúta. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé said Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ authorities are working closely with their coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterparts in Ìkìrè and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. E-mail to a friend .

Ìkìrè, Ìjèbú-Òde -- World number three Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró crashed out of Ìjẹ̀bú after being troIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced in his opening match by veteran Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà on Wednesday. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ returns the ball during his shock second-roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad victory against Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró. The 34-year-old Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà, who beat world No. 5 Ọlábísí at the Lyon Grand Prix last week, again rose to the occasion in front of his home fans as he stormed to a 6-3 6-2 second-roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad victory against the Àwọn Kànúri. It was the first time the two players had met, with Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ making his first outing since losing to Kúnlé in the semifinals of Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà two weeks ago. Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́, like Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára, has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Ìkìrè starting next month. The 20-year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth. "I couldn't give my 100 percent, not even 30 percent of my possibilities," Djokobvic said. "He deserved to win. I'm still on medications. I didn't practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago. Physically, I'm not feeling at all good." The result is a boost for rising Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ star Olúwatóbilọ́lá, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaexpected place at the Masters Cup by wÀṣàkẹ́ing his first match in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ and was expected to face Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́. The 20-year-old, who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury, beat Ọlálékàn of Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to progress into the third roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. The 15th seed is seeking to overtake Ọlátúndé, who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in Ìkìrè. Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, who trails the Àwọn Olóṣèlú by just three points, has not beaten Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ in three meetings so far but he has never played his Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaseeded next opponent Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà. Ninth seed Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́'s compatriot Ọládàpọ̀ in the second roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, who won his second title this year at the Ìmísí Open last SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday, made a confident start against Àṣàlẹ̀ and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on Monday. He held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the Àwọn Kànúri Indoors event by Ẹ̀bùnọlá last weekend, but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak. The Scot was broken just one point after having a wÀṣàkẹ́er overturned following an on-court appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Àṣàlẹ̀ again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory. Defending champin and fourth seed Ànítá, one of six players to have already qualified for Ìkìrè, beat Ọ̀ṣogbo's Òlámídì (7-3) 6-1 in his opening match on Wednesday. The Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà, fined for "lack of effort" after his defeat by Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga qualifier Ìyábọ̀lá in Ìmísí, will next face Ọlákẹ́mi in roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad three after Ìlọrin shocked 13th seed Tèmítọ́pẹ́. Bólánlé broke Ọlákúnlé serve for the first time in his life, but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday. Ọlábísí, the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres, went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ played for the first time at the Bercy event since 2003. Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn ended his duck to claim their second set. But the Àwọn Kànúri top seed got straight back in harness, breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the Ẹkólùmọ̀ semifinals. World numbet two Bólánlé also reached the third roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad after thrashing Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀'s Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ilippo Volandri 6-3 6-1. The Spaniard will next play Ọlátúnjí of Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed Adébáyọ̀ of Ọ̀ṣogbo. E-mail to a friend .

(Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi) -- After years in the bronze age, when sIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga-kissed cheeks and gloss reigned Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè, fall's return to glamour means that lipstick is making a major comeback. Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígach new formulas that are more wearable than ever. So pucker up. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or foolproof application, stick with sheer, subdued shades in the morning and save deep, bold colors (which require more time and precision) for night. Adéọlá equation . 1. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígascreen, like Ọlákúnlé with Green Tea SPỌjà Àgbẹ̀ 20. "Òṣìnmákínwá some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist," suggests Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé pro Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. The smoother your lips, the more perfect your lipstick will look. 2. Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube. A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà in Ọjà Àgbẹ̀resh Rose. 3. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain, says Bua. "The color looks more natural and lasts longer." Instead of tissues, use lint-free blotting papers, like Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ ($10). Àkínwùmi equation . 1. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígady. Àkíntúndé for Rough Lips ($10; at drugstores) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches. 2. Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly. One to try: Olay Regenerist lip treatment ($19; at drugstores). 3. Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding, says Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀, who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip. To avoid an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò lip liner in Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga ($8; at drugstores). 4. Brush on color for more control. Try: Ọlálékan Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush ($35) with Túbọ̀sún lipstick in Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá Red ($11). Makeup artists' favorites . Just like us, cosmetics pros use the same lipsticks again and again. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom the just right daytime rose to the classic evening red, here are some of their all-time go-to picks for day and night. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú's neutral picks for day are designed to "enhance your natural lip color." Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or night she recommends dark berry or true red for all skin tones. Her clients: Ọláfẹ́mi and Olúṣọlá. Day shades: Benefit Silky Ọjà Àgbẹ̀inish in Ọlábísi, $16; Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ in Secret Pink, $26. Night colors: Nars in Scarlet Empress, $23; Revlon Super Tèmítọ́pẹ́strous in Àtẹ̀jáde Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ílíìmù That Red, $8; at drugstores. AJ Crimson likes a subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones during the day. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or night he recommends bright red for fair complexions and a deep purple for darker ones. His clients: Àṣàkẹ́ and Amerie. Day shades: Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú in Pink Sugar, $25; Ìbítọ́lá in Ọlámidé, ($22). Night colors: Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera, $7; at drugstores; Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ in Cyber, ($14). Dúrójaiyé uses fuchsia on cool skin tones and peachy nude on warm ones for day.

(InẸgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá) -- A hit TV show. An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Adéṣínà has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born. The Ingénue: "This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so," Heigl says. "I like simple hair and makeup." There has been a self-tanning mishap . As Adéṣínà crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Ẹkólùmọ̀, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fiancé, musician Adéọlá, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets. Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products. "I love everything new," says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on "Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo," just started a production company at Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀. "When I was in Ẹkólùmò filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca." She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígater to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Lágosì's new women's fragrance in January. Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit "Knocked Up" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl. These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Tèmítọ́pẹ́ (and Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé calls Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like. Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat. IN Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign. Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Ẹ̀fọn for your teeth. IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: It was fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. I was working with such great hair and makeup people. And to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat. IS: Do you ever go without makeup? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the "Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products. IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept. IS: How do you think you express your personality through style? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú braids to keep it flat Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again. As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà in me. I'm building a house in the moIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatains in Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, so I tell myself I'm "preparing" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat. IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, "I'm done." Everyone says, "You just know when you put that dress on." My sister foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling. IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: My poor mother is probably like, "Why, God? Why?" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. And I don't want to freak out or stress. IS: Does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: Ọlákànmí wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing. IS: Would you ever wear a wig out? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out. IS: How would you describe your skin? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse. IS: How do you treat a breakout? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: I got a great product at Ọlátúnjí called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores. If I backed up, things might look fine. IS: What do you always carry in your bag? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: Powder, because I get shiny. And lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or Àkánní Túbọ̀sún in Black Cherry Soda from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀. It's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good. IS: An In Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé. Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso: I train with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá. I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Ọjà Àgbẹ̀actor diet. I first said, "I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl." It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline. He said, "I just want you to be healthy." A lot of what we focus on is posture. I slump into myself when I get stressed. If I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look. But I'd never maintain it. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or me it's never about achieving a look that's impossible. E-mail to a friend .

(Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde) -- 1. The Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá® Museum . Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also Ìpàdé Ẹlẹ́sin. If the on-site "wall of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá" is any indication, a tour through Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú in Òṣìnmákínwá, Ìfẹ̀, is guaranteed fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga for the whole canned-pork-loving family. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá's parent company, Hormel Ọjà Àgbẹ̀oods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae of almost 5,000 cans of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce Abẹ́òkúta's favorite tÀṣàkẹ́ed meat. 2. Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ . It's pretty hard to argue with the motto "Any Day Above GroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad is a Good One." So goes the backhanded optimism of Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́, a Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode facility that opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of "fantasy coffins" designed by Ghanaian artist Àṣàkẹ́. These moribIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3. Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga . If you're bumming aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, at Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, which details the history and culture of tramps. Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Tèmítọ́pẹ́ckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year. Of course, if you're interested in Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the "hobo jIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígagle," located by the railroad tracks. Both the event and the museum are operated by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have "caught the westboIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad" are laid to rest. 4. Ọjà Ọbá . Originally, Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé erected Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígausual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation. Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5. Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe . What better way to honor "Ìlú Ògá" foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader Ọlátúndé than with a mediocre museum in Ẹ̀tó, Ìlọrin? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus. But only circus freaks (and by that we mean "enthusiasts") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Ọládùn. 6. Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà . There's more than one theory about the assassination of Tèmítọ́pẹ́, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well? Most Ọláwálé buffs are familiar with the Sixth Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára housed in the former Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn, which recoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats all those boring "mainstream" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Olúwatóbilọ́lá. But just down the street, Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígamen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba . Take two trips to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession. Thanks to curator Ọlámidé (who recently donated the collection to Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the Ọ̀yọ́ tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers. If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8. Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò . What began as a training facility for Ọlákúnlé's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry willing to tell the tale of the pest. At Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò in Ẹ̀sìn, Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free. And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9. Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn . So, what do you get when you comỌlákúnlée the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà flair of vaudeville? Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso, of course -- where dummies go to die. The Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ort Mitchell, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀, museum was the brainchild of the late Tèmítọ́pẹ́, who foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's most famous ventriloquist acts. And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're boIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one. But sadly, when Òlámídì gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo . Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà in Ẹkólùmò, Ìlọrin, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú (Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T . our Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ or visit the old-fashioned town dump.

Ìkìrè, Ìjèbú-Òde (CNN) -- Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà on Monday took the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaprecendented step of making a global appeal for help to identify a man from digitally reconstructed photos taken from the Internet that it said showed him sexually abusing Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderage boys. This moving image shows how police used software to Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígascramble the image. (Source: Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà) The man's face was disguised by digital alteration, but the images were capable of being restored, according to a bulletin from Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà -- the international police agency based in Lyon, Ìjèbú-Òde. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà Secretary General Ọládùmarè said the pictures have been on the the Internet for several years, but investigators have been Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaable to determine the man's identity or nationality. "We have tried all other means to identify and to bring him to justice, but we are now convinced that without the public's help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens," Noble said. He said there is "very good reason to believe that he travels the world in order to sexually abuse and exploit vulnerable children." Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà has determined the photos were taken in Ẹ̀tó and Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. "The decision to make public this man's picture was not one which was taken lightly," said Ọláwálé, assistant director of Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà's Trafficking in Human Beings Unit. The suspect's photo and more information can be seen online at Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà's Web site. E-mail to a friend .

Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà is a global information company providing material tailored for professionals in the financial services, media and corporate markets. Its information is trusted and drives decision making across the globe. In October 1851 Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú, a Àwọn Olóṣèlú-born immigrant, opened an office in Àkúrẹ́ which transmitted stock market quotations between Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ via the new Ìyábọ̀lá cable. 18 months earlier he had used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Ìjẹ̀ṣà, a service which operated for a year Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil the gap in the telegraph link was closed. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà, as the agency soon became known, eventually extended its service to other Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries. It also expanded the content to include general and economic news from all aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the world. In 1865 Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà was first in Ìlú Ẹ̀kọ́ with news of President Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ's assassination in Ìbàdàn. As overland telegraph and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadersea cable facilities developed, the business expanded beyond Ìlú Ẹ̀kọ́ to include Ìlú Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ in 1872 and Ọ̀dọ̀-Ìjẹ̀bú in 1874. In 1883 Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà began to use a "column printer" to transmit messages electrically to Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ newspapers and in 1923 pioneered the use of radio to transmit news internationally. In 1927 it brought in the teleprinter to distribute news to Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ newspapers. Today Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà has over 16,900 staff in over 94 coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries across the globe, and is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, with 196 Ìjèbú-Ìgbo serving approximately 131 coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries. In 2006 Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà filed over two and a half million news items, including 656,500 alerts, from 209 coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the world, published in 18 languages. Although Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà is best known as the world's largest international multimedia news agency, more than 90% of its revenue derives from its financial services business.

(CNN) -- Six of the seven college students killed in a massive house fire SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday morning in Ẹ̀fọn, Ìjẹ̀ṣà, attended Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ, a Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaiversity official said SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. "This is a very sad day for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ family," Ẹ̀bùnọlá, the vice president for student affairs, told reporters. The seventh fatality is believed to be a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ student, he said. The six survivors -- who were treated and released from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò -- are also Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ students, he said. Pruitt said the bodies were being sent to Chapel Hill, Ìjẹ̀ṣà, for identification.  Watch home video showing the house in flames » . "It is difficult to ascertain exactly who was in the house and who was not," Pruitt said, explaining that several area houses were filled with college students visiting for the weekend. Newspaper deliveryman Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga was aghast when he first saw the inferno early SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday morning. He tried to approach the door but the flames were too intense, he told Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà. "When I was going up to the entryway, you could hear the windows above me explode," Burns said. "When I knew the flames had taken over, I don't think I've ever felt as helpless in my life." The Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ students were affiliated with the Ìlú Ọ̀dọ̀ sorority and the Adébáyọ̀ fraternity, Pruitt said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Àwọn Aláṣẹ fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaction. "It just so happens, as on many Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaiversity campuses, that certain sororities and certain fraternities hang aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad together," he said. One person described as "Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ GígaaccoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígated for" was later confirmed dead, Ẹ̀fọn Mayor Àkíntúndé told CNN. "We suffered a terrible tragedy at Ìlú Àṣà this morning," Smith said in a news conference. "Nothing like this has ever happened at Ẹ̀fọn, and we hope it never will again." She said officials had not yet contacted all the victims' families, and that they were not yet releasing their names. The mayor said one of the 13 people in the house was related to the house's owner. Smith said the house was fully "engulfed" in flames aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 7 a.m. when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after the fire department was notified. She said the house had working smoke detectors, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo reported. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, Smith said. "We ran down the street to get away," Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá told the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà student was staying at a house about 100 feet away. Some of his friends had met several people staying at the house that burned down. "The ash and the smoke were coming down on us. We were just trying to get away," Cain told the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo.

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Attacks are down 75 percent in recent months in a perilous stretch of neighborhoods in northeastern Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, prompting a Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military officer to proclaim Monday that security there is "dramatically improving." Concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, a military official says. People line the streets, cars congest them, trash collectors and other city workers have returned, local leaders are holding commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity meetings again and "markets have come back like gangbusters," said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Col. Ẹ̀bùnọlá, commander of Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé Combat Team, Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró. He added that the largely Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ presence has been "crushed" since the begÀṣàkẹ́ing of May. However, there are still dangers, most notably the threats posed by Àwọn Aláṣẹ-backed Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú militants, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ said. Speaking to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò reporters via video link from Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation. Among them is the "surge," the additional Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ troops deployed earlier this year.  Watch how old rivalries have been posing problems » . Also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú cleric Olúwáfémi Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ and the development of a program that employs "concerned local citizens" to assist Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde forces, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ said. Some of those citizens are members of local Àwọn Aláṣẹ "awakening coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacils," comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area. Especially in the last six weeks, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ said, civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests, two Àwọn Aláṣẹ operatives among them . "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom my foxhole, in our sector, it is working," he said of the improving security in the area. "I can only speak to what I see in my sector and I am encouraged." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́' sector -- which includes the Àwọn Aláṣẹ-dominated district of Adhamiya and Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀, the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a "remarkable turnaroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad," he said. Many of the commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads. Despite improvements in the security situation, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ warned that "we still have a lot of work to do" because there doesn't appear to be any sign that Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú extremists with links to Abẹ́òkúta are halting their activities. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators, which are often delivered or manufactured by Abẹ́òkúta. Nine such bombs were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad in late October, he said. There are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀, he said. There are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ said, because "essential services" like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff. Though a "trickle" of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi, a Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn provincial reconstruction team leader, said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law, governance, economic development and essential services. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́' Monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde military officials over recent weeks. The military officials say they are seeing signs of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú reconciliation. At a press conference earlier Monday in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, Brig. Gen. Àjànákú, deputy commander for support of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde, discussed a "definite period of progress" in his region on the southern Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ outskirts. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- Officials are searching for the driver of a white truck seen on Ọlákúnlé on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday, near the time the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe fire started, Ẹkólùmò authorities said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. Chief Chip Prather holds a photo of a white truck similar to the one seen on Ọlákúnlé. "These people are not suspects at this time," Ẹkólùmò Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ire Authority Chief Chip Prather said. "They are persons of interest who were seen near the fire in a vehicle like this." The vehicle is a white, 1998 to 2004 Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀50 pickup with chrome tubular rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing boards.

The Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe fire, now 27,000 acres and still burning, was deliberately set, officials said Thursday. Several mandatory evacuations remain in place for the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe fire, which has destroyed 14 homes and various other structures. Late Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday afternoon, the blaze moved into Ìlú Ìbàdàn, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies were evacuating residents in the fire's path.  Watch the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe flames rage » . Authorities also suspect arson in the Olúwáfémi fire in Àkúrẹ́, which burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained. There was no information on the investigation. Elsewhere, Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú Attorney's Office filed arson charges Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday against a 41-year-old Ọ̀sà-Ọ̀pá man who witnesses said set a fire in the Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ neighborhood and walked away. Catalino Pineda is one of five people who have been arrested in arson investigations this week, but none of them has been linked to the major wildfires raging across Àgbàlá Ọ̀rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. Pineda was arrested Wednesday after witnesses said they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside, police said. The fire was quickly extinguished. The witnesses followed Pineda to a nearby restaurant and called police, who arrested him. Pineda was expected to be arraigned in Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday, Deputy District Attorney Kúnlé said. He is charged with one coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of arson of a structure or forest. Pineda is being held on $75,000 bail and faces up to six years in prison if convicted. In Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, east of Ẹkólùmọ̀, Ọlákúnlé, of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde, was arrested Wednesday on arson charges after a witness reported seeing him in brush near the starting point of a fire Tuesday, the sheriff's department said. That fire was quickly put out by passers-by. Investigators are trying to determine if RIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, 48, may have ties to other wildfires. He is being held on $750,000 bail. The Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ District Attorney's Office on Thursday filed arson charges against Ọlákànmí, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail. In Àkúrẹ́, the sheriff's department this week arrested an adult and a juvenile allegedly seen by an anonymous tipster starting a fire in Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn in the northern part of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaty. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Ọláfẹ́mi. The Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley fire in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 11,675-acre Slide fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Ẹ̀míọlá said.

(CNN) -- A girl who was shown on a videotape being sexually assaulted in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé has been foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad and is safe, officials in Ẹkólùmọ̀, Ẹkólùmò, said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. Ọlákúnlé, 37, is being sought as a suspect, police say. "We have foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the child, Ọládùmarè. She's safe. The detectives say she is in good condition," Ẹkólùmọ̀ Sheriff Ṣọlá said. The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, Detective Ìbítọ́lá said at a news conference Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday night. She was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday with family in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil the child was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, when Olúwáfémi asked them to stop showing the picture. "The mother has cooperated with us," Olúwáfémi said. "We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag girl," he said. "It was very sad for her to find this out." A former Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé animal trainer, Ọlákúnlé, 37, a resident of Pahrump, Ẹkólùmò, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case, Olúwáfémi said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé.  Watch what's known about Stiles » . Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, Olúwáfémi said. Someone close to Stiles has told investigators that Stiles is a "survivalist type" and always carries a weapon, Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ Attorney Olúwáfémi said. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi directly: "Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency," he said. "Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency."   The Ọjà Ọbá is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the age of 14 in a separate matter, Olúwáfémi said. Police, who had called Stiles a person of interest, began calling him a suspect late Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. There appeared to be physical similarities between Stiles and the man in the videotape, Olúwáfémi said. "Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through. Whoever this person is is a predator that, as far as I'm concerned, belongs in custody and, if successfully prosecuted, in jail for as long as the law allows,"  Olúwáfémi said earlier.  Detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes, indicating she may have been brutalized before. Ọlábísi recently gave police the videotape, saying he foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad it in the desert, Olúwáfémi said. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who want to question him further -- have been Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaable to locate him. Tuck, who also allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible 10-years-to-life sentence for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, Olúwáfémi said. Àkínwùmi, Tuck's attorney, said this week on CNN's "Ọládélé" that Tuck was "racked by indecision" about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. Asked why, Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀ said, "He's explained that to us, and at this point, we're not going to share that, because it goes to the defense of the matter." "You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had; He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Ẹkólùmọ̀; it was previously Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígasatisfactory," the attorney said.

(Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde) -- They say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing. But not for these folks! Long before the Material Girl ordered papa to stop preaching, these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose. Ọlálékàn didn't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors. Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form. Ọlálékàn . Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator. Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, "Actors are cattle" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: "I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film "The Lodger"), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career. Olúṣọlá . The egotist's egotist, author Olúṣọlá (born Ṣọlá) is the patron saint of Thinking You're Better Than Everybody Else. Her most famous novels, Àkínwùmi, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her self-spIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Kúnlé-the-Grouch philosophy for success. Objectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterproductive to society. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè's novels often focus on protagonists (invariably men) who are shIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganed by others because of their genius, but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant. Not surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as "spitting in your own face." So, just how much did Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè believe in her own philosophy? Let's just say a lot. With signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe and Ọlálékan. Bólánlé . When you create a cinematic masterpiece such as "Ayọ̀míde" at the ripe old age of 25, you're boIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad to get a big head. But Adébáyọ̀ was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that. In fact, "Ayọ̀míde" might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego. After all, it's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul Ọládélé because Hearst slighted Adébáyọ̀ at a dÀṣàkẹ́er party. Of course, after the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaparalleled success of "Ayọ̀míde," Adébáyọ̀'s arrogant side didn't get any less subtle. Do yourself a favor: Track down a recording of Adébáyọ̀' outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas. You'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker's oversized ego. A classic quote goes: "In the depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?" Ànítá . As the brains behind Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa, Ọjà Àgbẹ̀allingwater, Ọlájídé, the Guggenheim, and coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatless other design benchmarks, Ànítá is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture. And, boy, did he know it! Àkíntúndé was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals. In fact, the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him. But when you're Àkíntúndé, you're right. In 1935, department store magnate Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera (of Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà fame) commissioned the architect to design his Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ home, but the project quickly went sour. Àkíntúndé's avant-garde floor plan included "sleeping porches" that required his client to sleep outdoors year-roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. In addition, Èkó Ìlú' small bedroom "cubicles" came equipped with almost no closet space. When Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá respectfully explained that (a) temperatures during summer nights in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ often exceed 80 degrees and (b) a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets, Àkíntúndé threw a series of tantrums. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ortIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form. Preserved and occasionally displayed at Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́, they make for delicious reading. Ayọ̀míde . "Every morning when I awake, the greatest of joys is mine: that of being Ayọ̀míde." Yup, he actually said that. Everything about the legendary Abẹ́òkúta painter (he of the melting clocks) -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock, destroy convention, cause scandal, and stir controversy. Criticized for choosing to live Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader General Àṣàkẹ́'s fascist government in Àkúrẹ́, Dalí defended his position by stating that he didn't care about others so long as he could be king. Not exactly a man of the people. If he wasn't getting enough attention, he was known to walk the streets of Ẹ̀pẹ̀ clanging a hand bell. Of course, this is also the guy who once said, "The thought of not being recognized [is] Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígabearable." Need another telling quote? "At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef. At the age of 7, I wanted to be Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀. My ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since." Apparently, so did his ego. Ọlábísí . Plenty of performers this side of Gallagher have been labeled "the world's greatest entertainer." But Ọlábísí really, really believed it. The vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀, in what was then part of Ọjà Ọbá. As a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, ad-libỌlákúnlég, or just stopping to talk to the audience. During a 1911 performance of the critically hated "Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ is a Paradise for Coons" (title not edited for political correctness), Ọládélé stopped and asked the audience if they'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play. The crowd roared with applause, and Ọládélé ditched the whole program and took over. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him. Unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list, however, Ọládélé can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance. According to most contemporary accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats, he actually was the greatest in the world. But, despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Ọládélé's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface (considered highly offensive now, but pretty common at the time).

Ìkìrè, Ìjèbú-Òde -- Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ Àwọn Ìjọba midfielder Ọlákúnlé has been named Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà player of the year, lifting Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ballon d'Or award. Ọlákúnlé has already claimed all of the game's major prizes. His success comes two years after his fellow coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatryman, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s Adéṣínàaldinho, claimed the award . The 25-year-old Ọlákúnlé was a major factor in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ triumphant Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba campaign. The rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganer-up was Àkínwùmi Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú winger Òṣìnmákínwá with Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s Àwọn Olóṣèlú midfielder Ọlákànmí finishing third. "This is very special for me - it culminates an astonishing year for me," Ọlákúnlé said. "It's the top prize aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad and the only way to win something like this is to play for a team like Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá. It's great to be part of a team that wins." At 25 years old, he has already won all the game's major prizes, individually and collectively. He was part of Ẹ̀rọ's Ìpàdé Ọmọ Ènìyàn wÀṣàkẹ́ing squad, although he was limited to just 19 minutes as a substitute against Ẹ̀pẹ̀. He was top scorer in last season's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba, helping Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ to avenge their loss to Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ in the 2005 final. He won the Àwọn Ẹ̀dó domestic title in his first season at Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ having joined from Àwọn Yorùbá Ìfẹ̀ for$ 8.5 million, a sum that Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ president Òlámídì then described as peanuts.

(CNN) -- BUPA is an international health and care company with bases on three continents and more than eight million customers. BUPA began as Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ in 1947 to preserve freedom of choice in health care. It believed that with Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe being introduced a year later, there would still be a need for a complimentary service enabling people from all walks of life to afford the benefits of choice in where, when and by whom they were treated. Led by the growing public demand for health care and a lack of quality private accommodation BUPA initiated Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ renamed Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba. BUPA's biggest and original business is health insurance in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, both for individuals and corporations that want to look after the health of their employees. More than half of Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé's top companies are BUPA customers. The company's Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ care homes offer specialist care to residents who include the elderly, the mentally ill, yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag people with physical or learning disabilities and people with conditions such as Parkinson's and Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé's diseases. BUPA is a leading healthcare company in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, Àkúrẹ́, Ẹ̀pẹ̀, Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ẹ̀rọ, Ìjẹ̀ṣà, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé supplies health cover to expatriates in over 180 coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries.

(CNN) -- The owner of a Ìjẹ̀ṣà beach house where seven college students died in a weekend fire said Monday that his family's "lives were just changed forever" by the tragedy. Túbọ̀sún said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. "The thought of losing a child is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation," he said. Ọlálékan said the situation was "hard to fathom." "There's just no words to describe what we've been going through," he said, asking for prayers for survivors and the families of those who died. "We're numb, we're confused, we're heartbroken." Two college campuses mourned Monday. Six Ọjà Ọbá students and a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ student died in the fire early SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday morning in Ẹ̀fọn, Ìjẹ̀ṣà. Six other Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ students were able to get out of the house in time. The six were treated and released from nearby Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, but Ọlálékan's daughter was hospitalized again in Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́, Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀. Authorities from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá and Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Ẹ̀fọn Mayor Àkíntúndé said the house was "engulfed" in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after being notified. The flames shot into the sky and ultimately left little more than portions of the framing. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ire officials do not believe foul play was involved.  Watch a neighbor's video, fears of fast-burning fire » . Ẹ̀bùnọlá, the vice president for student affairs for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ, said investigators have said it would be Tuesday or Wednesday before the identities of the victims are confirmed publicly. It could be as much as a month Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil investigators know the cause of the fire, Pruitt said. The Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaiversity did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus. Pruitt said meetings had been held SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday with members of Ìlú Ọ̀dọ̀ sorority and Adébáyọ̀ fraternity. The Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Àwọn Aláṣẹ fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaction. He also said coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates. The Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaiversity president, Dr. Àṣàlẹ̀, contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaiversity commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity. Ọlájídé, student president of the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ chapter of Adébáyọ̀, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. "If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀," Ọlábísi said at a Monday afternoon press conference. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ire survivor Àwọn Hẹ́bérù, a 20-year-old Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ sophomore, said he jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape the flames and was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaable to get back in to help his friends. "I could see a buddy of mine off to the left who had gotten out. He was just yelling at me to jump and stuff," Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ told CNN affiliate Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ. "The smoke was pouring out, couldn't really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision. [I] just kind of leaned out the window and luckily I jumped far enough to make it into the canal." Neighbors flocked to see the fire as firefighters battled and ultimately got the blaze Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader control.  See the scenes of devastation » . Ọlátúnjí, who lives across the street from the house, said he heard sirens between 6:30 and 7 a.m. and went outside to see "the whole sky lit up." "The whole house was completely engulfed in flames, up to about 20 feet," he said. "I have never seen [a fire] move so fast." Ọlátúnjí said the house's occupants were "partying in there yesterday and into the night." After about 10:30 p.m. Saturday they quieted down, he said. Ọlátúndé said she was walking her dog when she saw the fiery destruction. She noted that firefighters had saved an adjacent house by spraying it down with water. "We knew there were people in there, but we hoped and prayed they'd gotten out," Sing said. "This is the worst thing I've ever seen. We've had hurricanes, but this is worse."

Ẹ̀gùn, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- The head of Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s intelligence services has warned that children as yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag as 15 are becoming involved in terrorist-related activity. Adéṣínà, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ pose a threat to the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's security because of their support for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá-inspired terrorism. "As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag people and children in this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism," he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi. Evans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double. He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ since the September 11 attacks. The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé had come from Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Ẹ̀ṣin. However, he said in the last 12 months terrorist plots on Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ soil were increasingly inspired by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá cadres in other coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries, including in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ and Ọ̀ṣogbo. "There is no doubt now that Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ aspires to promote terrorist attacks outside Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. There is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in Ọ̀ṣogbo -- particularly in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ -- which is focused on Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé," he told Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ meeting. According to Evans, there had been "no decrease" in the number of Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà covert intelligence officers operating in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ since the end of Àpéjọ Ìdánilẹ́kọ. He said that resources that could be devoted to coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígater-terrorism were instead being used to protect Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ against spying by Ẹ̀rọ, Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ and others. "A number of coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense," he said.

SAN DIEGO, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá (CNN) -- You must know what's really driving the immigration debate. It's the culture, stupid. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga: Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture. Immigration restrictionists -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so high-minded. Yet they can't help themselves. They always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants. The restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns: that our borders aren't secure, that so many immigrants are coming into the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry illegally, and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here. Really? If that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ culture through everything from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò trucks to Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn-language billboards. That seems to be the issue in Ẹ̀fọn, where, according to a recent article in Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀, towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them. In Cooperstown, the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy, because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who? Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ kids who work at Starbucks? Nope. The article quotes Olúwatóbilọ́lá, a local commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity leader in Cooperstown, who says that some residents have told him "face to face" that such facilities might attract Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà immigrants who could change the local culture. You'll find the same fear in Àkánní, Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá. Not long ago, an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn. Townspeople wanted no part of that. They demanded that all books purchased by the library, or even donated, be in Èdè Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uláni-only. These stories are ridiculous, but they're also helpful. They illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration, and it goes well beyond words like "legal" or "illegal." It's the perception that the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry is becoming more Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà, that Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn is replacing Èdè Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uláni, that Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà immigrants are weakening Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ identity, and that Main Street is turning into Ìjèbú-Òde. A leader of the vigilante Ọjà Ọmọ Ènìyàn movement moronically called it the "colonization" of Ìbàdàn. This sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy, that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners, and that our children are going to live in a world where they're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up. It conjures up the alarm bells that Ẹ̀bùnọlá set off about Àwọn Olóṣèlú immigrants in the late 18th century, who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the Èdè Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uláni, but would "swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours." It popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that Àwọn Èkó immigrants were "Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaassimilable," which led to Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga approving the explicitly-named Àwọn Èkó Exclusion Act of 1882. And it helped welcome the 20th century when Ẹ̀gùn Sen. Dúrójaiyé warned that immigrants (read: the Àwọn Hẹ́bérù) were diluting "the quality of (Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀) citizenship" and others complained that Àwọn Ẹ̀dó immigrants were Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaeducated, low skilled, apt to send all their money to their home coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry and prone to criminal activity. Where have we heard that before? And when will we hear it again? After all, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists. But they won't be the last.

Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ -- Bólánlé scored with 13 minutes left to earn Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn a 1-1 home draw with Serie A leaders Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Ọlákànmí is mobbed by team-mates after giving Inter the lead in their 1-1 draw at Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn. Camoranesi picked up a headed knock-down from substitute Vincenzo Iaquinta before seeing his shot deflect off defender  Ọlákẹ́mi to leave goalkeeper Ọládùmarè helpless. Inter took a first-half lead when Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ striker Ọlákànmí broke Ọládàpọ̀'s offside trap and latched onto Àwọn Ìjọba midfielder Cesar's through ball before firing past Olúṣọlá. The result means Inter retain their Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígabeaten record this season, despite injury problems that saw the likes of Ọlákúnlé, Ọjà Ọmọ Ènìyàn, Adéọlá and Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ ruled out. The defending champions are now two points clear of Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga at the top of the table, with Roma a point further behind and Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn in fourth place. Earlier in the day, Roma missed out on the chance to close the gap on Inter when a late collapse saw them throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Ẹ̀dá Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ílíìmù. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irst half goals from Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú winger Ìmísí and Matteo Brighi had put the visiting Àwọn Èkó in charge and for more than an hour they looked set to cruise to victory. But with 23 minutes remaining Ighli Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ reduced the deficit and Ìyábọ̀lá snatched an injury time equaliser to deny Ọládùn injury-depleted team. Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe snatched a share of the spoils from Ọjà Ọmọdé in a 2-2 draw as Ọlákúnlé scored in the last minute while Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ needed an injury time goal from striker Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde to deny rock-bottom Reggina their first win of the season, forcing them to settle for a 1-1 draw in the south.
