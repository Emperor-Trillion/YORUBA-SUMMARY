Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀, Ẹ̀ṣin (CNN) -- Ẹ̀ṣin's foreign ministry Wednesday rejected concerns raised by the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára nuclear watchdog chief that the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's nuclear weapons "could fall into the hands of an extremist group in Ẹ̀ṣin or in Ẹ̀gbá." Ọládàpọ̀, the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára nuclear watchdog chief. fears for Ẹ̀ṣin's nuclear weapons. Ọlátúndé comments to Ọlákúnlé newspaper were "irresponsible" and "Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígawarranted," foreign ministry spokesman Àjànákú said at a news briefing on Wednesday. "Ẹ̀ṣin rejects the statement by Dr. ElBaradei, Director General Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò (International Atomic Energy Agency), hinting at the possibility of its nuclear weapons falling into the hands of extremists," according to a ministry statement. "As head of the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò, which is a Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára body, he has to be careful about his statements which ought to remain within the parameters of his mandate. "His remarks also ignore the fact that the strategic assets of Ẹ̀ṣin are fully secure and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader multilayered safeguards and controls exercised by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára." In an interview published in Ọlákúnlé Tuesday, ElBaradei said that Ẹ̀ṣin's recent political instability makes it more sensitive to susceptible to problems in other Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries. "The effects of any new war in Ìlú Ìlú Gíga and the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ world could have repercussions, not only in Abẹ́òkúta, but what I fear most is the effect in Ẹ̀ṣin, a nation with many internal problems," ElBaradei said. "I fear a system of chaos or extremist regime in this state, which has 30 or 40 nuclear weapons." Ẹ̀ṣin has been in a state of political upheaval since the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's opposition challenged President Ìyábọ̀lá tight grip on power, pushing him to step down as military chief and lift the emergency rule he had imposed in early November. The coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry further spiraled into chaos after the December 27 assassination of leading opposition figure and former Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ prime minister Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. In response to the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò director-general's comments, Ẹ̀ṣin's foreign ministry stressed in its statement that ElBaradei, "on several occasions, has been briefed about the structure and control mechanisms put in place to ensure complete safety of our nuclear assets." "Ẹ̀ṣin is a responsible nuclear weapon state. Our nuclear weapons are as secure as that of any other nuclear weapon state. We, therefore, believe statements expressing concern about their safety and security are Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígawarranted and irresponsible. "Ẹ̀ṣin attaches great importance to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò and has extended cooperation and assistance to the Agency on many important issues towards the fulfillment of its mandate. Our civilian nuclear program is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò safeguards and we have always fully complied with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò obligations," the ministry said. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- After expressing condolences and outrage over events in Ẹ̀ṣin, presidential candidates turned their discussion toward whose foreign policy credentials were better. Kúnlé, then Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ first lady, meets with Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in Ẹ̀ṣin in 1995. In a campaign that had been drifting toward economic issues, the assassination of former Prime Minister Ẹ̀míọlá  Bhutto and the turmoil in Ẹ̀ṣin could refocus voters on who is best qualified to deal with crises in other parts of the world. "My theme has been throughout this campaign that I am the one with experience, the knowledge and the judgment. So, perhaps it may serve to enhance those credentials," said Sen. Ọlálékàn, R-Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. Locked inside a tough three-way battle for the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà nomination in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, Sen. Kúnlé has spent a year calling herself the most experienced, most qualified candidate in the field. She stressed her ties with Bhutto and the tragedy of her death. "This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime, and it certainly raises the stakes high for what we have to expect from our next president," the Ìjẹ̀ṣà senator said.  Watch how the assassination is resonating on the campaign trail » . Sen. Òlámídì's camp, which has spent a year pushing back on criticisms that he lacks experience, insisted they welcome the renewed talks on foreign policy and called attention to Ọlákànmí's "yes" vote on Àjọyọ̀ Ìbílẹ̀. "She was a strong supporter of the war in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ which we would submit is one of the reasons why we were diverted from Ẹ̀gbá, Ẹ̀ṣin and Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú, who may have been players in this event today. So that's a judgment she'll have to defend," said Ìbítọ́lá adviser Ọlákẹ́mi. The Ọlákànmí campaign said the suggestion that her vote caused Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígarest in Ẹ̀ṣin is baseless, adding that this is a time to focus on the people of Ẹ̀ṣin and not politics. When asked about Olúwatóbilọ́lá's remarks late Thursday, Ìbítọ́lá told CNN's Ọlákànmí that, "This is one of those situations where Ẹ̀rọ is putting a spin on it. ... He in no way was suggesting Kúnlé was somehow directly to blame for this situation." The Ìfẹ̀ senator added that "it's important for us to not look at this in terms of short-term political points scoring."  Watch the showdown on foreign policy » . But the candidates all reacted, in part because of the gravity of the event, in part because they are just days away from the January 3 Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ caucuses. Conversation quickly moved from condolences to campaign issues. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Ìjẹ̀ṣà Mayor Ọlákẹ́mi talked terrorism, connecting the attack in Ẹ̀ṣin to the September 11, 2001, attacks. "Abẹ́òkúta feels a connection because of the attacks that took place here," he said. Àkíntúndé, who along with Ayọ̀míde scores best on national security, blIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatly challenged Ayọ̀míde's foreign policy experience.  Watch how the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè candidates are reacting » . "He did a great job post-9/11 in handling a post-crisis situation, but I don't know how that provides one the credentials to address national security issues," he said. Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá Gov. Ọlábísi said he would call on Ẹ̀ṣin's President Pervez Musharraf to step down. "What is in Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ interest is for there to be a stable, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀sìn Ẹ̀ṣin that is fighting terrorists. Right now, we have the worst of all worlds," he said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday on CNN's "Ìtàn Ẹ̀sìn." But Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá Sen. Ọlákúnlé said calling for Musharraf to step down wouldn't be a good idea. "I hope that we as candidates out here don't start lobbying these ideas that get plenty of attention but are not very soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad," Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà told CNN. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Ìjẹ̀ṣà Sen. Ọlámidé said he called Musharraf and "urged him to continue this democratization process." Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà hopeful Ìmísí, chairman of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé, said Bhutto's death was a "genuine tragedy."  Watch how the Àwọn Olóṣèlú are responding » . "Ladies and gentleman, the stakes are incredibly high. They are incredibly high. If Ẹ̀ṣin falls into complete turmoil, martial law is declared again, you end up with a state that is being rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga by a dictator; ladies and gentleman that does not bode well for Ẹ̀gbá, Abẹ́òkúta, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, Ẹ̀gbá," he said. The shift in focus might not play out well for former Ẹ̀gbá Gov. Ànítá, whose foreign policy credentials have been Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader a microscope since he admitted to journalists that he was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaaware of a major report on Abẹ́òkúta's nuclear weapons program. He appeared to make another minor gaffe Thursday when he seemed to suggest incorrectly that Ẹ̀ṣin was currently Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader martial law. Later Thursday, Huckabee told CNN that "it was not that I was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaaware it was suspended, two weeks ago, lifted. ...The point was, would it be reinstated, would it be placed back in? All of the aspects of martial law have not been completely lifted even now. There's still a heavy hand Musharraf has used." If voters see a high-stakes drama in Ẹ̀ṣin, that could resonate at the polls. Most of the candidates said they didn't want to turn the assassination into a talking point, but it is just a week before the Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ caucuses, and world events not only change the conversation -- they can change a campaign.

Ẹgbẹ́, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ (CNN) -- I was 14 at the time. Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's civil war was in full flood. One afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in Ìfẹ̀. A Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà woman and her son rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga through west Ìfẹ̀ in 1989 during fighting between rival forces. We ran from school screaming. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orget the book bags, classmates, homework. Just rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. Out of breath, my knees giving way, it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block. The memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil recently. After more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction, the bomỌlákúnlégs and assassinations have returned to Ìfẹ̀. Every time I hear of a new explosion, I think of a frightened child sitting in darkness. In 1988, I watched the last throes of Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà, sad, frustrated and often fearful.  See a timeline of Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's recent history » . Now I watch from another continent, but I find those same emotions resurfacing. The conspiracies, the car bombs, the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar. The actors are like shadows from a long gone past. They are grayer perhaps --  those who have avoided assassination. But the cast in Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's tragedy has changed little in two decades. Then, as now, a presidential election is the setting, and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set Ìjèbú-Ìgbo back 20 years.  See bios of Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's major players » . In 1988, the president's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaable to agree on a new candidate. Militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building. Compromise was nowhere in sight. The West had abandoned Ìjèbú-Ìgbo to the manipulation of its neighbors. Èkó Ìlú had its choice for president; Ọ̀ṣogbo had its own allies -- a foil for growing Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá radicalism. The coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry was awash with weapons. In his last act as president, Ayọ̀míde named fellow Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Chief Ọládélé as prime minister. At a stroke, he shattered the convention that a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá hold that position. Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà refused to serve in the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe and the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry ended up with two governments. Ẹ̀bùnọlá famously declared: "I am prime minister and six ministers in one." Ẹ̀bùnọlá's "War of Liberation" against Èkó Ìlú turned into defeat. Then, he turned on fellow Àwọn Ìjọba of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá in Ìpàdé Ẹ̀dá." When that failed, the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ayé drove Ẹ̀bùnọlá to take refuge at the Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú Embassy. In August 1990, I came to CNN as a World Report panelist. I tried to explain Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's chaos, the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians. I had seen people killed in front of me; children orphaned in seconds, parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins. So when I was offered the opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity to stay at CNN, I gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy. But almost as I left, the civil war was being laid to rest. The various factions had fought each other to a standstill; Àwọn Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ulani governments, supported by the West, helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú influence. Peace came to Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, but it would be five years before I returned. In 1995, I went back and was stIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganed. I kept looking aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad for checkpoints manned by militants. I couldn't believe that I could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another. No longer did identity -- Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá or Túbọ̀sún -- define where Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà could go. People mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble, laughing at the same jokes. It was as if Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser. Downtown Ìfẹ̀, once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes, was rocking to Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà pop music. The dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà fashions and deluxe hotels. Àtẹ̀jáde Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ílíìmùrs had returned to Ìfẹ̀'s Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú, overlooking the Ìlú Ẹ̀dá, for romantic strolls at sIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaset. But the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a "pax Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá." As Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà sentiment grew, so did political tensions. On Ọlábísí's Day 2005, the Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú was once again rocked by an explosion.  Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Prime Minister Ọládàpọ̀ was killed. The symbolism left me speechless. On the day of love, Ìjèbú-Ìgbo was thrown back into its most hateful history. It had been widely expected that Hariri would rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga for office again and demand the withdrawal of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú troops. Suspicion fell on Ọ̀yọ́, which vehemently denied involvement. On March 14, Martyrs' Square became a human sea of demonstrators: Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà, Túbọ̀sún and Àwọn Ìjọba alike, demanding the "truth." But Hariri's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken Ìjèbú-Ìgbo a generation previously. Even after it withdrew its troops, Èkó Ìlú still had allies in Ìjèbú-Ìgbo. One was Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà, accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn in Ìfẹ̀ more than 20 years previously. Another was Gen. Ọládélé; now back from exile, the same Ọládélé who had defied Èkó Ìlú in 1989, but who now made common cause with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà against his fellow Àwọn Ìjọba. Earlier this year I visited Martyrs' Square. The spirit of Ìpàdé Ẹ̀dá Ayé had evaporated. The place looked like a morgue. Anti-government Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà squatters had brought life there to a standstill. As I passed through, business owners stood silent in the sIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga and shook their heads at me in despair. I wondered if they sensed my disappointment, my pain at watching Ìfẹ̀ bleed again. Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago. Once again, the term of the president is approaching its end; there is no agreement on his successor. Suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day. And the questions haIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats me: Will the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries? E-mail to a friend .

Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ -- Seven Àṣàkẹ́ supporters were taken to hospital after violence flared before the 1-1 Champions' League draw against Roma in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀. Àṣàkẹ́ supporters were segregated inside Àpéjọ Ẹ̀sìn Ọmọ Ènìyàn for the Champions tie. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga officials in Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ said five fans received stab woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads while two others, including a 16-year-old boy, needed treatment for being drIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígak, Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà reported. None of the stab victims is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstood to have serious injuries following the clash between the rival fans outside the Stadio Olympico. An embassy spokeswoman said: "Seven Àṣàkẹ́ supporters were taken to hospital after fighting broke out on the Pont Duca d'Aosta bridge which fans cross over the river to get to the stadium. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ive are receiving treatment for stab woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads while two others, one who was a 16-year-old boy, were Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstood to be drIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígak. "Their injuries are not thought to be serious and most of them will be discharged in the next couple of hours. One person may be kept in overnight for observation. "The situation in the stadium is now fine and everything is rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing smoothly." The embassy had warned travelling fans beforehand not to use the Pont Duca d'Aosta bridge because it was habitually used by Roma's notorious Bólánlé - a following of hardcore fans. Roma coach Ọlámidé condemned the latest violence. "It's difficult to give a comment on what has happened," said Spalletti. After watching a video replay of the ugly scenes, Spalletti added: "These people are sick." The trouble marked the second consecutive game between Roma and Àṣàkẹ́ in the Àwọn Ẹ̀dó capital which has been marred by violence. Eighteen Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú needed hospital treatment in April after clashes on the terraces in Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ and outside the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà boss Sir Ọlájídé had hoped tonight's game would pass off peacefully but Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà in Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ had warned supporters faced a "real danger of attack" by the Bólánlé. The 1,200 Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ supporters who made the journey were largely shepherded into the stadium two hours before kick-off, with clear segregation in place in the less than capacity crowd.

Ìjẹ̀bú, Ẹkólùmò (CNN) -- An intense manhIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader way Monday for Dúrójaiyé, a 37-year old man whom police say is a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3-year-old girl four years ago. Ọlákúnlé, 37, of Ẹkólùmò is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a 3-year-old girl. Also Monday, Stiles' former girlfriend told CNN she believes she put him in contact with the girl. Ìyábọ̀lá said she  is "disgusted" and "mortified" at her role in bringing them together. Ẹkólùmọ̀ Sheriff Ṣọlá said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday the girl has been foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad and is safe. He said the child's mother was cooperating with authorities. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi directly: "Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency. Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency." Stiles' former girlfriend said she is stIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganed by the allegations.  Ṣọlá describe her first impression of Stiles » . Olúṣọlá said she and Stiles had been in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years and that he was good with her children. "He said he'd been in the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be," Olúṣọlá said. Olúṣọlá took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her 3-year-old daughter, who allegedly was victimized by Stiles. "I'm disgusted. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, mortified," Olúṣọlá said. "I regret every, every step I ever took; I feel bad for the baby." Ọládùmarè, Àkánní son, told CNN he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. He said his mother and Stiles spent time together there. Ọládùmarè said nobody realized the child may have been abused. "She's what you'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like," he said. He said he never witnessed Stiles physically assault anyone. "But I have seen him verbally and mentally assault many people," Ọládùmarè told CNN. Looking back, Ìyábọ̀lá said there were some warning signs. She said Stiles hit her once but she didn't file a police report. She said she blames herself. "How could I not know? Why couldn't I have recognized something? Why are all these people going through this torture now because of me?" Olúṣọlá asked. Olúṣọlá ended her relationship with Stiles a few months ago. She said she believes it will be difficult for police to find him. "He will hide out in moIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatains if that's what it takes, he will hide out in a crowd, he'll find somebody who hasn't heard anything and stay there," she said. "He has skills. He knows how to hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat, I mean hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat with a gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, a knife, a bow." Olúṣọlá said Stiles stopped by her house last week for a friendly visit before his name was linked to the videotape. She said his appearance had changed. She said his hair was longer and he had put on weight. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Ẹkólùmò, is a former animal trainer, authorities said. Olúwáfémi said the Ọjà Ọbá also is seeking him in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader 14. The man who claimed to have foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday to Ẹkólùmọ̀ officials. Dúrójaiyé, a Ẹkólùmò resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible sentence of 10 years to life for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, according to Olúwáfémi. Tuck's attorney, Àkínwùmi, said last week on CNN's "Ọládélé" that his client had been "wracked by indecision" as to what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. E-mail to a friend .

"Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ jihadist" Kúnlé, originally from Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá, in a video released in September 2006. The 50-minute tape -- titled "An Invitation to Reflection and Repentance" -- was released by As Sahab, Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró video production wing and was provided to CNN by www.ỌlábísiMansfield.com, a Web site that analyzes terrorism. In it, Gadahn renoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaces his citizenship to protest the imprisonment of Sheikh Ọlákànmí, a blind Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ọlọ́rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga leader serving a life sentence for his role in the 1993 attack on Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò; and Ọlátúndé, the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ who was arrested in Ẹ̀gbá in 2001, and others. Gadahn displays his passport to the camera, rips it in half and says, "Don't get too excited -- I don't need it to travel anyway." Though Gadahn speaks mostly in Èdè Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uláni, he references Olúṣọlá -- who is to travel this week to Ìlú Ìlú Gíga -- only in Èdè Hausa. "We raise an urgent appeal to our mujahedin brothers in the Àwọn Yorùbá, Ìlú Àgbàlá in particular, and the region in general, to be prepared to receive the crusader butcher Olúṣọlá on his visit to Àwọn Yorùbá and the occupied peninsula at the begÀṣàkẹ́ing of January," he said. "They should receive him not with roses and applause, but with bombs and booby-traps." The video also refers to Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, indicating it was produced after last November 27, when the conference was held. Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú Spokesman Ẹ̀bùnọlá said the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ president would not be deterred. "His comments are indicative of an Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá ideology that offers nothing but death and violence," Ọlálékandroe told CNN in a written statement. "President Olúṣọlá will travel to the region to stand with the mainstream governments who want liberty and justice for their people." The self-proclaimed Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ jihadist, also known as Azzam the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́, is on the Ọjà Ọbá's Most Wanted List, with a reward of up to $1 million for information leading to his capture. Gadahn was indicted in 2006 on charges of treason and offering material support for terrorism, the first Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ charged with treason since Àpéjọ Ìjọba. Gadahn, who grew up in rural Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá, embraced Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà in the mid-1990s and moved to Ẹ̀ṣin.

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- During the 1960 presidential election, Ọládùn helped then-Sen. Tèmítọ́pẹ́ draft a speech addressing Adéṣínà's Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀kọ́ism and the separation between church and state. At the time, many questioned whether Adéṣínà, who would go on to become the nation's first Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ọdọ́ president, would be influenced by the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀kọ́ church. Ọládùn helped write Adébáyọ̀ 1960 speech on Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀kọ́ism. Speaking to CNN Senior Political Analyst Ọlákúnlé, Sorensen discussed Adéṣínà's famous 1960 speech and compared it to the speech on faith in politics delivered Thursday by Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso presidential candidate Ọláfẹ́mi, who would be the first Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára if he is elected. Question: Did Adéṣínà's 1960 speech win him the presidency? Sorensen: Well, he obviously didn't lose it, nor did he free the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry from the curse of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde. The hate mail still poured into his office. The vicious picket signs were still seen out on the campaign trail, and, indeed, on Election Day. According to a Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe survey, more people voted against Adéṣínà because of his religion than any other reason. Nevertheless, that speech, which was nationally broadcast and frequently rebroadcast, certainly took a lot of the poison out of the Àwọn Ìjọba issue and reassured all reasonable people.  Ọlábísí discuss why Adéṣínà gave his speech » . Q. Could President Adéṣínà have delivered the speech Romney gave on Thursday? Sorensen: No. Mr. Romney's position on many of the issues are very different than Ọláwálé's. Ọláwálé wanted to particularly stress that he believed in the separation between church and state. He believed that no one needed to worry about a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀kọ́ bishop or a cardinal dictating to him as a president, and that freedom of religion included freedom for those to go to any church or not to go to any church at all. So, Romney emphasized the role of religion in public life more strongly than Ọláwálé did or would have. Adéṣínà seemed to differ quite strongly with Adéṣínà on the privacy of religion, didn't he? Sorensen: Yes, he did. In fact, Romney felt compelled for some reason to define his personal views of Àkíntúndé. Adéṣínà said, as you noted, his personal views of religion were totally his business and not the business of the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people. Adéṣínà made the statement "freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom." Do you think Adéṣínà would have agreed with that? Sorensen: I don't think anyone would disagree strongly with that. There were some lines in the Romney speech that echoed the Adéṣínà speech. As an old speechwriter, I would congratulate Mr. Romney. It was a pretty good speech. I think he touched all the bases he wanted to touch. Adéṣínà discussed his views of Àkíntúndé, something that Adéṣínà avoided. Why did Adéṣínà avoid discussing his religious views? Sorensen: Because [Adéṣínà] began the speech by saying his private religious beliefs -- his relationship with God or Àkíntúndé or anything else -- was not a matter of public discussion. He did not think the election should be based on -- as he said, it's not what kind of church I believe in, the question is what kind of coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry do I believe in. Ọlátúnjí speech in 1960 is widely viewed as being successful. Do you think Romney's speech is likely to be viewed as a success? Sorensen: I assume so. I don't think Mr. Romney should be denied the presidency because of his religion. Just as I don't think Senator [Barack] Ìbítọ́lá should be denied because of his race. Or that Mrs. [Àṣàlẹ̀ should be denied the presidency because of her gender. This coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry is in deep, serious trouble, and thoughtful citizens surely are going to make up their minds based on the major issues confronting the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry and the major qualities of the candidates and not on such superficial tests as religion, race, or gender.

(CNN) -- The Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ 777 is the mainstay of many airlines' long-haul fleets and has never been involved in a fatal accident during its service history. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ aircrew fly Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe from the flight deck of the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ 777 aircraft. The aircraft first entered service on JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae 7, 1995, with more than 900 suppliers from 17 coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries coming together to provide the more than three million parts needed in its construction, according to the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ Web site. Since its inaugural flight, Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ has extended the 777 family to five commercial passenger models and a freighter version, collectively making more than two million flights. The aircraft seats between 301 and 368 passengers in a three-class configuration and can fly distances up to 17,500 kilometers. The 777 has also won a number of design awards, as well as setting a number of records and firsts. On November 9 and 10, 2005, a Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ 777-200LR Worldliner set a new world record for distance traveled non-stop by a commercial jetliner. The 777-200LR set a record distance of 21,601 km on a route traveling eastboIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad from Ẹ̀rọ to Ẹ̀gùn. The flight lasted 22 hours and 42 minutes. The achievements was recognized by Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ and the GuÀṣàkẹ́ess Book of Records. Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá recognized the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ 777 in April 1997 for achieving a speed and distance record for airplanes in its size and class. The Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ Web site claims the 777 set the "Great Circle Distance Without Landing" record, traveling 20,044 km, and it set the record for "Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára," traveling at an average speed of 889 km per hour. According to Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ the aircraft reached 500 deliveries by 2005 -- faster than any other twin-aisle commercial airplane in history. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ prides itself on the 777's landing gear, which it claims is the largest ever incorporated into a commercial aircraft. Each main landing gear is fitted with six wheels, while the nose gear has two. E-mail to a friend .

Ìkìrè, Ìjèbú-Òde (CNN) -- A major donors conference to raise fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads for the Àwọn Ìgbò has gone beyond expectations, with donors pledging $7.4 billion to help build a Àwọn Yorùbá state, organizers said Monday. Ìjèbú-Òde's Olúṣọlá, left, welcomes Àkínwùmi and Àwọn Yorùbá leader Ọládùmarè on Monday. Other delegations at the Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ meeting are offering aid in kind, such as Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, which said it would provide monitoring of the Àwọn Ìgbò' promised reforms to reassure donors that their money would be used efficiently. Àwọn Yorùbá Prime Minister Salam Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayyad called the pledge of money a "vote of confidence" in the Àwọn Ìgbò. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ormer Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ Prime Minister Àkínwùmi said the support of donors needed to be repaid in the coming months with steps to create a lasting settlement. "Over the next few months, we have to show people our capability of making the difference on the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad," said Blair, who co-hosted the conference in his new role as envoy for the so-called Ọ̀dọ̀-Ìlọrin of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, Èkó Ìjọba, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera and Ẹ̀rọ. The Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ conference focuses on short-term priorities for the Àwọn Ìgbò, and Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú President Àkánní said those include providing immediate support for the Àwọn Yorùbá people -- particularly those living in Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ -- and stabilizing the Àwọn Yorùbá economy.  Watch CNN's Ọláfẹ́mi explain the conference's aims » . It follows on the heels of last month's peace talks in the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ in which Àwọn Hausa and Àwọn Yorùbá leaders vowed to negotiate a final-status agreement by the end of 2008. Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú President Àkánní said Ìjèbú-Òde would donate $300 million, and Ìbàdàn was expected to pledge more than $500 million. Central to the Àwọn Ìgbò' request for aid is a three-year reform plan that the Àwọn Ìgbò prepared for the conference. The plan, which covers 2008 to 2010, centers on economic development and government reform. Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ praised the plan, calling it a "promising effort" to link policy-making, planning and budgeting. But in a report released Monday, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ pointed out the reforms would succeed in helping Àwọn Ìgbò only if they were accompanied by both donor aid and Àwọn Hausa actions. Àwọn Hausa Ọjà Àgbẹ̀oreign Minister Ọlátúndé spoke of taking such actions, saying Ọ̀ṣogbo is committed to meeting its responsibilities Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader Ìlú Ìlú Gíga road map, especially regarding the contentious issue of settlements. Ọládélé said an agreement had been reached with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo to provide training for Àwọn Yorùbá police. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ President Ọládùmarè said the Àwọn Ìgbò didn't lack will or determination but resources. He promised donors that Àwọn Ìgbò would work hard to create a modern coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry in control of its security. "We are at a historic stage today, and the destiny of our region and peace depends on this," said Ọlákúnlé, who requested the conference be held. Ọlákúnlé earlier had requested $5.6 billion in aid over the next three years. Ọlákẹ́mi repeatedly told the conference he is a "friend of Ọ̀ṣogbo," but he urged the Àwọn Hausa government to withdraw troops from Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá, freeze settlements, reopen institutions in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and help the isolated population of Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ report detailed the challenges facing attempts to revive the Àwọn Yorùbá economy, which has become almost totally dependent on foreign aid. Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ is the largest employer for its people, as private-sector jobs dry up. Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ said wages for public sector employees accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat for almost half of the government's expenditures. With public investment having nearly ceased, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ said, almost all government fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads in the past two years have been used to pay salaries and cover operating costs. Staffing also has gone up in the health and education sectors, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ said, leaving little money for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, teaching and learning materials, and overall maintenance. Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ said the reforms would only succeed if they include Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀, where 40 percent of the Àwọn Yorùbá population lives. Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ has been subject to a wide-ranging crackdown since Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde took power in JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae; its borders are closed, fuel imports are restricted, and there are strict limits on all imported goods. "The continued entry of humanitarian goods has mitigated the impact of the closures on Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀'s population, but has not been sufficient to offset the collapse of the private sector there," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ report said. Unemployment across the Àwọn Yorùbá territories stands at nearly 23 percent, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ said, but in Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀, 33 percent of the population is out of a job. It predicted the figures would rise if the restrictions continue. A report Monday from Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró spotlighted the pressures on private Àwọn Yorùbá businesses, especially in Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀, where it said the private sector "is on the verge of collapse with no scope for recovery" Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaless Àwọn Hausa restrictions are lifted.

Lantos' life was "defined by courage, optimism, and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígawavering dedication to his principles and to his family," said his wife, Annette, his childhood sweetheart, in a statement Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba released. Secretary of State Olúwatóbilọ́lá said Monday that she was "quite devastated" by the death of her "dear, dear friend." She called him "a true Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ hero" and "the genuine article." "He's going to be really, really missed," she said. Ọlákúnlé described Lantos as "the embodiment of what it meant to have one's freedom denied and then to find it and to insist that Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga stand for spreading the benefits of freedom and prosperity to others." Lantos, who was serving his 14th term in the Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in December. He annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced last month that he would not seek a new term. "It is only in Ìbàdàn that a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and a fighter in the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ GígadergroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad could have received an education, raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga," Lantos said in a statement at the time.

The lawmaker is the only Holocaust survivor to have served in Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. The Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́-born Lantos came to Ìbàdàn in 1947 after surviving a forced-labor camp in his Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba-allied homeland. He escaped and was sheltered in a Ẹ̀sìn safe house set up by Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde diplomat Ọlájídé, who was credited with saving tens of thousands of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Àwọn Ìjọbas during Àpéjọ Ìjọba. He arrived in Ìbàdàn after being awarded an academic scholarship to study, according to his congressional Web site. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé in Ìjèbú-Òde and later earned a doctorate in economics from Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá, the site said. As a lawmaker, Lantos was an outspoken human rights advocate. He supported the 2002 congressional resolution that authorized President Olúṣọlá to laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígach the invasion of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ but later became an outspoken critic of the conflict.

Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ (CNN) -- All vehicles were banned from the largely Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú city of Amara Wednesday after three car bombs ripped through a market district, killing at least 27 people and woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded 151, officials said. Àwọn Tív gather at the site of a car bomb in the city of Amara on Wednesday. The blasts detonated in close succession in a commercial area in the central section of Amara, the provincial capital of Ọjà Ọbá province and a city that has been the scene of fighting between rival Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú factions. Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ was also hit by violence on Wednesday. A car bomb there killed five Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde civilians and woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded 15 others, an Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá official told CNN. The incident occurred in a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ section of the largely Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ district. Maj. Gen.

He said additional security measures have been put in place in the city. The first bomb, in a car parked in a commercial area, detonated about 9:30 a.m. As onlookers gathered, the second one exploded in a nearby garage a few minutes later. It was followed by a third bomb in the garage a few minutes after that. Ambulances and police raced to the scene.

(CNN) -- Ìbàdàn has enjoyed a reputation as one of Ẹkólùmò most stable nations since achieving independence from Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé in 1963. Residents of the Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ slum in Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga shout at demonstrators during violent clashes. But a booming tourism industry, impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to The Economist -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty, violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions. Tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in Ìbàdàn, with the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's 36 million people claiming allegiance to aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 40 different tribes. Last week's election pitched incumbent President Ṣọlá, a member of Ìbàdàn's largest Ayọ̀míde tribe, against opposition leader Olúwatóbilọ́lá of the Tèmítọ́pẹ́o tribe. The Ayọ̀míde make up about 22 percent of Ìbàdàn's population. Mostly originating from Ìbàdàn's central highlands, the Ayọ̀míde have long wielded strong economic and political power within the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. Ìbàdàn's first post-independence leader, Ànítá, president from 1964 Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil 1978, was a Ayọ̀míde. Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀, a government minister from 1965 Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil wÀṣàkẹ́ing power as head of Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn in elections five years ago, also enjoys the support of Ìbàdàntta's successor, Ọládàpọ̀, a member of the Ẹgbẹ́ tribe who ruled Ìbàdàn for 24 years from 1978 to 2002. The Tèmítọ́pẹ́o make up aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 13 percent of the population, mostly in the west of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. But they also form a sizeable commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity in some of Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga's most notorious slums, such as the vast Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ shantytown where Odinga enjoys strong support and where some of this week's fiercest violence has occurred. Odinga's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú is also backed by many members of the Ọlálékan tribe, Ìbàdàn's second largest ethnic group, after Odinga promised to make a leading Ọlálékan his deputy if elected. This week's violence came as election officials declared victory for Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for Odinga in the closest presidential vote in Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú electoral history. But the result has been questioned by international election observers, throwing the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's political future into doubt. Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀'s first election success in 2002 -- declared free and fair by international observers -- was hailed at the time as a step forward for Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú democracy. However, his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ (CNN) -- In the days after Ọládùn assassination, it will be tempting to reach two hasty conclusions: that she was Ẹ̀ṣin's last great hope and that her geo-politically crucial coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry has revealed itself to be  inherently hopeless. Irshad Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga is a controversial Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá feminist and activist from Ẹ̀ṣin, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá. On each front, I take a different view. While far more liberal and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀sìn than Gen. Musharraf, Bhutto disappointed moderate, modern Ọ̀ṣogbo with her adherence to feudal politics. Writing to me through my Web site, Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ feminists say they are "aching" over the loss of "our dear, sweet, brave Ẹ̀míọlá." I Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand the sentiment. But "brave" is not the word used by Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ women from whom I've also heard. They're hurting more over Bhutto's "self-imposed" conformity. "She never realized her potential," a woman from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa tells me. "And not because she was killed but because when she had the chance, she did not effectively challenge the backward mindset that has now led to her demise." Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or example, during Bhutto's time in office, Ẹ̀ṣin didn't defy the anti-female rape and adultery laws. Those notorious ordinances, known as Hudood, took their inspiration from tribal politics masquerading as Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà.  Watch Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga argue on CNN why Bhutto's legacy is mixed » . Imagine the opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity: Bhutto could have championed a purer faith by tackling corrupt cultural practices. In so doing, she might have created allies among conservatives, who can be persuaded that although Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà is God-given, culture is man-made. Last year, a media campaign to strike down the Hudood Ordinances achieved this fine balance. But not because of her. And that, say many progressive Ọ̀ṣogbo, amputates Bhutto's legacy. The fact that cruel laws against women can be publicly debated at all should suggest that Ẹ̀ṣin has hope anyway. An exceptional leader can tap into it. History tells us so. There was a time when Ẹ̀ṣin's Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀sìn politicians stuck it to the feudal fanatics. Bhutto's father, Ọlátúndé, was once heckled by a religious fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadamentalist. "You drink alcohol!" shouted the critic. "Yes," retorted the elder Bhutto, "but I don't drink the blood of the people!" His response captured the spirit of Ọlábísí, Ẹ̀ṣin's foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader. In 1947, Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀ exuded high hopes for his people: "You are free. You are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques, or to any other place of worship in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde. "You may belong to any religion or caste or creed. That has nothing to do with the business of the state. We are starting with this fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadamental principle that we are all citizens of one state... You will find that in due course of time, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde will cease to be Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà will cease to be Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà, not in the religious sense  ... but in the political sense as citizens of the state." Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀ meant every word of his Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaconventional vision because he, himself, lived as a maverick. He adored his Àwọn Hausa wife, and his sister often appeared with him on the campaign trail. Her visibility attested to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà's embrace of women as partners of men. In the months ahead, the people of Ẹ̀ṣin will need to recall Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀'s vision. It may be of comfort know that they're not alone. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga are now asking about their foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaders' intentions, desperate to re-discover the better angels of their coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry after eight years of Dúrójaiyé. Still, Ẹ̀ṣin must avoid Abẹ́òkúta's enduring mistake. Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ lapsed into profoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad divisiveness following the assassinations of Adéṣínà and Túbọ̀sún. Many would argue that today's politics of polarization can be traced to the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaresolved trauma of Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga murders. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or Ẹ̀ṣin, it's high time to transcend both trauma and tribalism. I pray that in death, Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga will be the catalyst for a deeper democracy than she ever advocated in life.

Ọlákúnlé newspaper quoted a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà official saying Olúṣọlá issued a royal pardon Monday -- the same day that the Ẹ̀míọlá, the annual Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá pilgrimage to Ọ̀yọ́, begins in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. The victim's husband told CNN he has not received an official letter regarding her pardon, but considers it to be legitimate since it was annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced in an official Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà newspaper. He thanked Olúṣọlá for the pardon, saying: "This fatherly care and noble gesture will help (in) lifting the emotional and psychological stress and suffering that our family has been enduring." "This is not something new because we know that the King was always generous in dealing with his people and the entire world," the husband said. "This week, we have two holidays to celebrate; the Eid and this great news of the pardon." Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà sources told CNN that the king's pardon was not related to the begÀṣàkẹ́ing of the Ẹ̀míọlá nor the Eid al-Adha festival that follows, which is normally when the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà monarch issues amnesty for prisoners. Watch how Àwọn Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ulani media is reporting the story. » . Ẹ̀sìn Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ Minister Ọlákànmí told Kúnlé newspaper that the king felt the pardon would be in the best interests of the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà people, and the decision did not reflect any lack of confidence in the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà justice system. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe welcomed Tèmítọ́pẹ́ decision, but Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú spokesman Ẹ̀bùnọlá stressed that "this is obviously a matter for the Àwọn Ọmọ Ẹ̀yàs and Olúṣọlá." A Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà court ruled the 19-year-old had an "illegitimate relationship" with a man who was not her husband, and that she was raped after she and the man were discovered in a "compromising situation, her clothes on the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad." The rape took place in Ọlámidé in March 2006 when the woman was engaged to be married. The case has drawn international attention, provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader strict Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ law in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. The woman was meeting with a man -- described by the woman's attorney as a former friend from whom she was retrieving a photograph -- when they both were abducted last March. Seven men, convicted of abducting the pair and raping her, were sentenced from two to nine years in prison. Ọláwálé, the lawyer who represented the woman, faced a disciplinary hearing for "insulting Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera and disobeying the rules and regulations" of the judiciary.  The hearing has been postponed. The woman's husband has been outspoken in his support for his wife. He called a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà TV show to defend her, when a former Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà judge claimed on the program that she "spoil(ed) their marital bed" by meeting an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígarelated male "in secret" and admitted her guilt. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ has said he hopes the case changes the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà justice system. "We want to highlight the rape crimes in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and the way they are handled and sentenced in court," he added. "This is a new era for all of us." He said that the rape case had elicited a fierce response, including calls for his beheading. Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ President Dúrójaiyé said last week that Olúṣọlá "knows our position loud and clear" on the case. Under Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery.

Ẹ̀gùn, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Claims by Ọlátúnjí's former butler that he knew a mysterious "secret" about the late princess have been trashed by the coroner in her inquest. Ọlátúnjí's former butler has given conflicting information at the enquiry into her death. The coroner said the information was already in the public domain and some of it was even mentioned in one of Àkíntúndé own books. Considered the first star witness of the inquest, Burrell's appearance Tuesday was delayed after the coroner asked him to retrieve the last letter the princess gave him. Monday, the ex-butler -- once described by the princess as "her rock" -- told the inquest the letter contained a "secret," which he claimed he could not remember. After returning to Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ from his home in northern Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ Tuesday, Burrell said the letter was not there, but at his home in Ọ̀ṣogbo. He then handed the coroner a note that he said contained the supposed secret. The coroner revealed that what Burrell referred to was that Ọlátúnjí was planning to buy property to live in part of the time and that the location may have been in Ìbàdàn or Ẹ̀pẹ̀. The coroner said the revelation is "fairly and squarely in the public domain" and that some of the information appeared in Burrell's book Ìtàn Ìmọ̀lẹ̀." Explaining the apparent discrepancies in his testimony, Burrell said he was confused by the cross-examination, which he described as "horrid" and "disgraceful." The questioning of the former butler is expected to continue Wednesday. Ọlátúnjí and her boyfriend, Dodi Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed, died in a Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ tIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganel in the early hours of August 31, 1997, along with their driver, Dúrójaiyé. They had driven away from Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ in a black Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé with paparazzi chasing behind. There has been speculation that the couple had planned a big annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacement the night they died. Photographers have testified they had heard rumors Ọlátúnjí would say she was getting engaged to Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed or having a baby.  Watch report on claims about Ọlátúnjí's marriage plans » . Burrell did not take the stand Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil Tuesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, the inquest heard from Ọlátúnjí's former lawyer, who said the princess had claimed Àkíntúndé was planning to abdicate in April 1996 and allow Òlámídì to be king. Ìbítọ́lá said at the inquest that Ọlátúnjí also believed there was a plot to seriously injure her in an accident. Rae said the claims came at a meeting with her legal team at Kensington Palace in which the princess also made clear her belief that the succession of the Èdè Ọjà Àgbẹ̀uláni crown should skip a generation to her son, Ìyábọ̀lá. The morning's evidence also heard that Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s top police officer had advised the queen against allowing Ọlátúnjí to go on holiday with Àjànákú, the father of Dodi. In a note from Chief Ẹ̀bùnọlá, head of Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso, that was read out to the court, it was stated that he and Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ Commissioner Sir Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ believed that the planned holiday was "Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígawise." Ọlábísi -- a successful businessman and owner of the Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ luxury store Harrods -- was considered a controversial figure at the time. Ọlátúnjí defied the advice and went on the trip. It was during this holiday on the tycoon's luxury yacht in the Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú resort of Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn that she met Dodi Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed. During her testimony, Rae also gave an insight into the princess's lifestyle, which she described as "odd" and "lonely." She said she did not believe Ọlátúnjí's claims of a conspiracy against her. "I remember one occasion when she told me about her weekend and she had been alone in those rather silent set of apartments. She had heated her own food in the microwave," Rae told the court. "I thought she lived in a very odd environment. I thought she was quite lonely." E-mail to a friend . CNN's Ọlákúnlé contributed to this report.

Ẹ̀gùn, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Princess Ọlátúnjí's relationships with two Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá men provoked an outburst from her mother, who called her daughter "a whore", Adéọlá, the princess's former butler, told an inquest Monday. Ọlátúnjí once referred to her former butler Adéọlá as "my rock." Burrell, who returned to Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ from his home in Ọ̀ṣogbo to give evidence, was the first star witness of the Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ inquest, now in its fourth month. His role as confidant to Ọlátúnjí, who died in a Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ car crash on August 31, 1997, along with her boyfriend Dodi Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed and hotel security chief Dúrójaiyé, meant his testimony was eagerly anticipated. Burrell, whom the late princess once called "my rock," cast doubt on whether Ọlátúnjí was ready to marry Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed. According to Burrell, the princess was still "holding a candle" for former boyfriend and heart surgeon Olúwáfémi -- who she called "her soulmate" -- when she started dating Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed "on the reboIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad." Burrell told the inquest that Ọlátúnjí asked him to listen in on a conversation in JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae 1997 with her mother, Ọládélé, who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá men.  "She called the princess a 'whore' and she said that she was messing aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad with 'effing Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá men' and she was 'disgraceful' and said some very nasty things," Burrell said. He agreed that, as a result of such calls Ọlátúnjí, decided not to talk to her mother again. The inquest, which began in October and is expected to last another two or three months, aims to Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacover the facts surroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading the deaths of Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn and determine their cause of death -- whether by accident or otherwise. Asked earlier in the day if he believed that Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed was "the one," Burrell said "no, I did not have that impression." He also cast doubt on claims that Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed and Ọlátúnjí were engaged or on the cusp of engagement, saying: "I find that difficult to believe." Asked to explain himself, Burrell said: "Because this was only a 30-day relationship and the princess had just finished a long-term relationship with someone (Àkínwùmi) she cared deeply about. I knew that because I was there and I saw it." Ọlátúnjí's 18-month relationship with Àkínwùmi ended aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the same time she started seeing Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed in July 1997. Burrell said Ọlátúnjí had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with Àkínwùmi might take place, given that Àkínwùmi is Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá.  Watch report on claims about Ọlátúnjí's marriage plans. » . Àkínwùmi had not proposed to the princess, Burrell said, adding that Àkínwùmi was "the man she loved more than any other." He said he spoke to Ọlátúnjí about the possibility that Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed would give her a ring shortly before her death. Burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand, rather than the left, as is customary with engagement rings. "I need marriage like a bad rash," Burrell claimed Ọlátúnjí told him. Last month at the inquest Túbọ̀sún, a friend of Ọlátúnjí, said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage "like a rash on my face." Burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring, as the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed family has maintained. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ayed family spokesman Ìyábọ̀lá testified last week that Dodi's father, Ọlákúnlé, was certain the couple had planned to marry. Lawyers at the inquest asked Burrell whether he knew whether a special annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacement had been planned for the Monday following the fatal car crash. There has been speculation the couple planned to annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígace special news, such as an engagement. But Burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan. He said he had actually looked at Ọlátúnjí's schedule for that day and foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad only mIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadane items, and nothing to indicate she planned a special annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacement. Burrell also told the inquest he did not believe Prince Ìbítọ́lá, Olúṣọlá, husband was involved in Ọlátúnjí's death. Ọlákúnlé, father of Dodi and the owner of Harrods department store, has long claimed that senior members of the royal family -- specifically the queen's husband, Prince Ìbítọ́lá -- ordered the pair be murdered. He also claims that Ọlátúnjí was pregnant at the time of her death. But Burrell said that he knew Prince Ìbítọ́lá very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths. "I can tell you that is not Prince Ìbítọ́lá's nature, " he said. "Plus the princess was the mother of his grandchildren. Why would he want to harm her? It's not possible." The inquest has seen and heard about correspondence which Prince Ìbítọ́lá sent to Ọlátúnjí, with some witnesses claiming that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters. But other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed, "Pa." Burrell explained that Ìbítọ́lá could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks. "Prince Ìbítọ́lá doesn't mix his words," Burrell said. "He says it as it is, but he is not a nasty man. Prince Ìbítọ́lá isn't known for his diplomacy. He was fond of the princess." Burrell worked for the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ royals for 21 years and became close to Ọlátúnjí after her separation from Òlámídì. He has written two books about his time with the princess. In his second book, Burrell told of a letter from Ọlátúnjí which indicated she feared for her life. The princess wrote that Òlámídì planned "'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury." One of Ọlátúnjí's close friends, however, testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged. Olúwáfémi said on December 18 that Burrell was capable of imitating the princess's handwriting. Lawyers questioned Burrell about the date of the letter. Burrell said it was written in October 1996, two months, after Ọlátúnjí and Túbọ̀sún divorced -- yet the letter refers to Túbọ̀sún as "my husband." Burrell responded that Ọlátúnjí always referred to Túbọ̀sún that way, even after the divorce. The inquest has revealed that Ọlátúnjí was a prolific letter-writer who also received a lot of correspondence. Witnesses, including Burrell, recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk, with the more important ones stored in a special box. Burrell testified that after Ọlátúnjí's death, her mother, Ìjèbú-Òdes Shand-Kidd, worked every day for a week shredding the papers from Ọlátúnjí's desk. He said he expressed concern about the shredding during a meeting he had with the queen on December 19, 1997. It was at this meeting that Àkíntúndé told Burrell: "There are powers at work in this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry about which we have no knowledge." That comment, which has been widely reported, was meant to warn him to be careful, Burrell said, and was not a warning about any one person or group of people. At the same meeting Burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of Ọlátúnjí's belongings to keep safe. The details of the conversation emerged when Burrell stood trial for their alleged theft in 2002, causing the case against him to collapse. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, Àwọn Ọdọ́ and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde leaders all held talks Monday about Àwọn Olóṣèlú rebels using northern Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ as a laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígachpad for cross-border attacks into Ìjèbú-Ìgbo. Àwọn Ọdọ́ troops patrol near the border with Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ on Monday. President Olúṣọlá chatted by phone with Àwọn Ọdọ́ Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Ọláwálé, while separately two senior Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ national government figures met with the head of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's Àwọn Olóṣèlú region. The diplomatic moves came after Àwọn Ọdọ́ warplanes poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded Àwọn Olóṣèlú separatist targets in northern Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ on Saturday and SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday as well as last week. Olúṣọlá and Ọláwálé talked about the dangers of the Àwọn Olóṣèlú separatist rebels along the Àwọn Ọdọ́-Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde border, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára confirmed. Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú spokesman Ẹ̀bùnọlá said they discussed their common efforts to fight terrorism, and the importance of Ìbàdàn, Ìjèbú-Ìgbo and Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ working together to confront Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú, or Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè. Olúṣọlá has vowed to help Ìjèbú-Ìgbo fight Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè rebels. The Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Àwọn Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ulani in southeastern Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, with some of its attacks laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígached from inside northern Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera consider the group a terrorist organization. Last week, Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's ambassador to Ìbàdàn, Àkíntúndé, said his coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's maneuvers against Àwọn Olóṣèlú militant targets in northern Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ were based on intelligence provided by Ìbàdàn. In the Àwọn Olóṣèlú Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ city of Sulaimaniya, Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde President Adéṣínà, who is Àwọn Olóṣèlú, and Vice President Ọlákẹ́mi, who is Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, met with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ President Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi. Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde Àwọn Olóṣèlú officials, while critical of the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè, have denoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced the Àwọn Ọdọ́ bomỌlákúnlég campaign. Last week, Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ snubbed visiting Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ Secretary of State Olúwatóbilọ́lá in protest of the attacks. "We have vehemently condemned the bombardment. The bomỌlákúnlég targeted safe and secure areas and Àṣàkẹ́ocent people. Several people were either killed or woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded," Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ said on Monday at a press conference with the others. "We held consultations with President Adéṣínà and we will continue our consultations with other concerned parties to put an end to these aggressions and put to an end the shelling of villages." The three Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde officials also dealt with national Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity.

Ìṣẹ̀dó, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá  -- Top-seed Ọlábísí easily defeated Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ wÀṣàkẹ́er Bólánlé of Ẹ̀ṣin 6-2 6-4 in the headline match at the ATP tournament in Ìjèbú-Òde on Thursday night. A pumped up Ọláfẹ́mi needed little over an hour to dispatch teenager Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá. Ọláfẹ́mi needed just 63 minutes to defeat the 18-year-old Àwọn Èdá who won his first ATP title on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday and was on an eight-match wÀṣàkẹ́ing rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. But Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ number one Ọláfẹ́mi imposed his quality from the start by taking a commanding 3-0 lead and breaking Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá's serve before the yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígagster won a game. Ọláfẹ́mi, who has won twice in Ìjèbú-Òde, repeated the break later in a feisty opening set which came to a head in the seventh game. Ọláfẹ́mi barked at the yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag player as they exchanged shots at the net. Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá held his cool, did not respond, and just walked away. "I didn't Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand a word he said," Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá said. But when pressed he acknowledged that he did in fact Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand what Ọláfẹ́mi had shouted at him but just did not want to repeat it before the press. But Ọláfẹ́mi had no trouble repeating what he had said. "I told him to stick me with it the next time. I just let him know that he needs to finish it. I had no problem with it. But it was a monologue." Ọláfẹ́mi duly roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded off the set in the next game and broke Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá's service in the fourth game of the second only for his youthful opponent to break straight back. But as Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá served at 4-5 to stay in the tournament he made two crucial errors. He missed an easy slam shot that would have given him the advantage at deuce and then saw his saw his volley go wide that gave Ọláfẹ́mi the match. "I made too many easy mistakes," Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá said. "I didn't take advantage of the many chances I had. But overall I was happy with the way I played." In the early evening match, Ọlálékan, beaten by Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá in the Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ final, overcame first-serve problems to beat Ṣọlá 6-4 6-4 to move onto the quarterfinals. The second-seeded Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀, ranked ninth in the world, will face Àṣàkẹ́ in the quarterfinals. "I thought I played well," Blake said. "I felt comfortable and although I had a slow start I was able to put pressure on Ọlábísi." In afternoon matches, Kúnlé beat third-seeded Àwọn Olóṣèlú Adébáyọ̀6 7-6 6-3 to advance to the quarterfinals. Isner, Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú second-tallest player at six-foot-nine, will next face Àkúrẹ́'s Ìmísí. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ, ranked 26th in the world, was three match points from wÀṣàkẹ́ing the second set in a tiebreaker before the 106th-ranked Isner rallied to win. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ifth-seeded Ọlákànmí also advanced, beating Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's Adéọlá 6-7 6-3 6-3 to make the quarterfinals for the second week in a row. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ish will face Ọláfẹ́mi in the quarterfinals. Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá's Ọládùmarè beat Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ lucky loser Àjànákú 6-4 6-4. Tèmítọ́pẹ́ will face fourth-seeded Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ Radek Stepanek in the quarterfinals. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN)  -- Several Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà who were involved in the November 2004 offensive in Ọjà Àgbẹ̀alluja, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, are now the focus of an investigation into allegations that civilians were intentionally killed during the operation, several Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò officials have confirmed. Members of the 1st Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò operate in Ọjà Àgbẹ̀alluja, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, in November of 2006. No one has been charged in the probe, which is based on what one official told CNN were "credible allegations" from a former Marine. That Marine volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígateered the information during an employment polygraph test administered by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́. Several sources familiar with the probe say Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba is conducting the investigation. The allegations first surfaced on a Web site, defendourmarines.com, posted by Àṣàlẹ̀, a military journalist who wrote a book about the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà in Ọjà Àgbẹ̀alluja. The Web posting includes an accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat from a Marine who alleges eight captured Àwọn Tív were gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganed down following a firefight. The weeklong anti-insurgent offensive in Ọjà Àgbẹ̀alluja began on November 7, 2004. It was called Ìpàdé Ìtàn, and it sparked intense fighting involving airstrikes and house-to-house searches. There were reports of civilians being killed in the crossfire at that time. The allegations are the latest involving Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà and civilian deaths in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. Seven Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà and a Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára medic were charged with killing an Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde civilian in Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ in April 2006. One Marine will serve eight years in a plea deal; another Marine withdrew his guilty plea, saying he acted Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader orders. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀our Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà were charged with murder in the 2005 killings of 24 Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde civilians in Haditha. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀our officers are accused of failing to investigate and report the deaths properly. Haditha was a target of Marine operations to root out insurgents. Both Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military law and international law of armed conflict prohibit the killing of Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaarmed captured prisoners, whether or not they are combatants.  E-mail to a friend .
