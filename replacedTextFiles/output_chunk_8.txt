Editor's note: Ọlálékàn is the assignment manager for the CNN Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígait. She has been a type I diabetic for 40 years. This is her story of life with diabetes. Ọlálékàn uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin. (CNN) -- When I was 7 years old, my mom took me to the doctor because I had lost a lot of weight, despite a voracious appetite. My family had just moved from the Ìlú Ẹ̀kólùmò Area to Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá, and this visit to the doctor's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life. His name was Dr. Ọlátúndé, and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes. He spoke to me directly, rather than to my mother, and he asked me questions: Did I feel thirsty? Did I need to urinate during the night? The answer to both questions was yes. He asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate. Dr. Deputy told me and my mother that my body wasn't processing sugar properly. I had diabetes. That is how my 40-year journey with diabetes began. I was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar, give myself injections of insulin, follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes. I spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease, and then they sent me home. Dr. Deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how I was doing. Much to my parents' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself. I refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine. This demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons, and not just for managing my diabetes. While some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden, I feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise. It forced our family to eat healthily, and it taught me about good nutrition -- something I practice every day. I know carbohydrate coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats in most foods, and I Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand dietary concepts that most people don't even care about. Being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar, so when my urine tested positive for glucose, my older sister Adéọlá was in charge of exercising me. We had coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatless jump-rope contests, bike rides and roller-skating excursions, keeping me and my three sisters active and fit. And I felt like a little mad scientist, using a test tube with drops of water, urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ortIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaately, over time, technology improved. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irst, test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it. But the truth is, testing urine for sugar was a primitive method. By the time sugar gets into the urine, it's a signal that the body doesn't have enough insulin to process sugar. And the urine test didn't give an actual number for the amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of sugar in the urine. It simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine. Inaccurate was really an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstatement when you talk about urine testing. Home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s, and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes. With the kit, the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood. The blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds. While I initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day, now I can't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing. The 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump. This device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin. The reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat. So rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body's insulin patterns, the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant, then gives extra amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats with meals. Another life-altering development in diabetes, which I have discovered in the last year, is the continuous glucose monitor, or Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso. This is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen, hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body's fluids. The data is transmitted to a receiver, and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels. I have participated in clinical trials for three different Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso devices, and I foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad them all to be quite accurate. Some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump, so you can use the reading to adjust and fine-tIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae the amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of insulin being pumped into the body. The patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated, but it's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars. Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type I diabetes using what's called a "closed loop system." This means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself. The current systems are "open looped," meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given. The goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system, and all the patient has to do is wear it. Once that technology is perfected, this type of device would be implanted, which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes. I mentioned to my sister Adéọlá that I had tracked down Dr. Deputy for this article. She told me something I didn't know when I was 7. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orty years ago, before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing, parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare. Dr. Deputy told my parents that I would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30, which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out. I spoke with Dr. Deputy, who recently retired from his pediatric practice, and he seemed to remember me. When I asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival, he said sadly, "At that time, that was what we told parents back then. ... Everything changes with time -- diabetes, leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment." I think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong. I know that I certainly am. In fact, I am hoping to live another 40 years! E-mail to a friend .

Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ won 23 caps for Wales and played on the Lions tour of Ẹ̀pẹ̀ in 1980. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ had been on holiday with his family in the Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn Ìlú Ẹ̀dá island of Mallorca at the time. A Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà statement praised Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ as being "a man who epitomized the passion, flair and dignity of his beloved Welsh nation." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ made his debut for Wales against Ìjèbú-Òde in 1975, three years after helping his club side Llanelli to their famous win over the touring All Blacks. In all he made 23 appearances for what was then a dominant Wales side, wÀṣàkẹ́ing Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978, and played all four Tests on the Lions' tour of Ẹ̀pẹ̀ in 1980. After retiring as a player in 1985, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ became president of Ànítá and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà. He also pursued a career as an actor and a respected rugby broadcaster. Earlier this year, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ had his right leg amputated below the knee following complications linked with his diabetes but he had been recovering well. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà chief executive Ṣọlá said: "We are all in total shock because Ray was so full of life even through the difficult health problems he suffered recently. "He was a wonderful ambassador for rugby and for Wales and a great example of how the game can bring out the best in a man. "As a player, he always gave a huge amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of respect to his opponents but never gave an inch of groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad to anyone he faced on the field of play.

COLUMBIA, Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN)  -- Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà Sen. Òlámídì kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday in Ìjẹ̀ṣà, Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, that Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaexpectedly came back to bite his campaign. Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential hopeful Òlámídì is competing for the black vote with Kúnlé. The concerts were meant to boost black voters' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the national radar. The ensuing controversy highlighted that Ìbítọ́lá's desire to Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader his umbrella of "change" is not without some serious pitfalls. When the campaign annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced the lineups for the three-city "Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ!" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Ọládùn. The Ọlákúnlé-award wÀṣàkẹ́ing singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was "once involved with those desires and those thoughts" but was able to get past them through prayer. To say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity. Ìbítọ́lá, a prominent gay blogger and co-foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader of the Web site Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn, led the charge against the Ìbítọ́lá campaign, writing that the Ìfẹ̀ Àwọn Èkó was "sucking up to anti-gay bigots" and "giving them a stage." When the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Ìbítọ́lá campaign by surprise. Ìbítọ́lá's efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted Àwọn Ìròyìn Ìjọba churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ from rival Sen. Kúnlé. The campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate's faith, laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaching "40 Days of Ọjà Àgbẹ̀aith and Ọjà Àgbẹ̀amily" in September, which used Ìtàn Ọmọde study groups to tap into the black electorate. Campaigners have rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga three radio ads, one of which called Ìbítọ́lá a "Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ family man," that aired on gospel stations across the state. Earlier this month, Ìbítọ́lá spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Ọ̀ṣogbo, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that "I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Pápá-Ìdí." After that appearance, the Ìbítọ́lá campaign told CNN that Àwọn Ẹ̀ka no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values. "I think that what you're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s," Ìbítọ́lá said. "At least in politics, the perception was that the Àwọn Olóṣèlú were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away." But on Tuesday, Ìbítọ́lá was forced to confront the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacomfortable truth that some Àwọn Ìjọba and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks. Ìbítọ́lá issued a statement saying, "I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of Ìbàdàn," and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious Àwọn Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ulani. A September poll of Àwọn Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ulani in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ by Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that "sex between two adults of the same sex" is "strongly Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaacceptable." Ìbítọ́lá held a conference call Wednesday with Ọlábísí, president of Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́, and annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced that the Rev. Ẹ̀bùnọlá, an openly gay Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ pastor, will appear at the same event as Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde. Solomonese was not completely assuaged. "I spoke with Senator Òlámídì today and expressed to him our commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to 'break the curse of homosexuality,'" he said in a statement. "There is no gospel in Ọláfẹ́mi message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That's a message that certainly doesn't belong on any presidential candidate's stage." The State newspaper in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde reported Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday that Ìbítọ́lá organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders. After the call, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ and Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced it will hold a protest vigil outside SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday's concert in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde. Privately, Ìbítọ́lá aides say they believe Ìbítọ́lá is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences. Ọlátúnjí refusal to kick Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà off the concert bill hurt him? Like many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, Ẹkólùmò and Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀. And in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, where Àwọn Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ulani make up about half of Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà at all. E-mail to a friend .

MADRID, Àkúrẹ́ -- Adéọlá recovered from their painful recent defeat by Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ to crush Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà rivals Real Zaragoza 4-0 in the Ṣọlá on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Ọládùn celebrates his first Adéọlá goal in their superb 4-0 victory over Real Zaragoza. Dúrójaiyé first goal for the club, a double from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára and a Diego Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orlan strike clinched a comfortable win as Ọládùmarè moved up to sixth in the table. It was also sweet revenge for Ọládùmarè as Zaragoza beat them home and away last season to beat them to sixth place and the final Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára spot. Ọládùmarè went ahead in the 10th minute when Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orlan picked out a precise pass for Ọlájídé who made no mistake with a calm side-footed finish. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orlan then got on the scoresheet himself with a first-time lob on 34 minutes for his third goal of the season, before Rodriguez stole the show with two more goals. Getafe registered their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory over Murcia. Substitute Kepa, who was later sent off, opened the scoring in the 54th minute and Ẹ̀míọlá added a second five minutes later to clinch the points. Elsewhere last season's second division champions Valladolid continue to struggle in the top flight, crashing to a 2-1 defeat against Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀. Ìmísí scored twice for Ìlọrin after eight and 31 minutes to leave Valladolid second from bottom with promoted Levante, who have a meagre one point, propping up the table. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ Secretary of State Olúwatóbilọ́lá said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ Secretary of State Olúwatóbilọ́lá says that "people need to serve where they are needed." Ọlákúnlé was responding to foreign service officers' objections to the possibility of "directed assignments" in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. The issue has caused an uproar in Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́, resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting Wednesday. The new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers don't step forward to fill open positions at Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀. If Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ enforces directed assignments, it will be the first time since Ìpàdé Àjọ Òṣèlú era. One official called the order to serve in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ "a potential death sentence" during the town meeting. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú already has begIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates. Those chosen will be given 10 days to respond, according to last week's annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacement. Unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse, those who decline could face dismissal, it said. Wednesday's heated meeting was replayed on an internal Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn television channel in Ẹ̀rọ several times and talked about widely. Some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly, learning about it instead from news organizations last week.  Watch the diplomats exchange angry words » . "I just have no respect for the whole process because you've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues," said foreign service officer Adébáyọ̀. "Thank you for that comment. It's full of inaccuracies, but that's OK," Kúnlé, director general of the foreign service, shot back. Others pointed out the risks of such assignments, considering the dangers of a war zone, lack of security and regular rocket attacks on Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ personnel. Ọlákúnlé, who did not attend the meeting, tried to calm things down Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday by Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderscoring Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ attempts to do "everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats." However, she said, "This is one of the highest priority tasks of Ìbàdàn, and we're going to meet our obligations." Speaking to reporters en route to Ìjèbú-Ìgbo and the Ìlú Ìlọrin, she said, "I don't know if we will have direct assignments or not, but we are one foreign service, and people need to serve where they are needed." The secretary sent out a cable to Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn employees worldwide encouraging them to serve in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. "This year [Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ Ambassador Ayọ̀míde] has identified the need for additional positions to more effectively accomplish our mission in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀," Ọlákúnlé said in the cable. Ọlákúnlé said she has decided to go forward with the identification of  officers to serve, "should it prove necessary to direct assignments." "Should others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before -- with volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígateers. However, regardless of how the jobs may be filled, they must be filled," she said. Ọlákúnlé earlier said reports that Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ was finding it hard to coax foreign service employees into Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ "couldn't be further from the truth." The assignments are new positions. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ifteen people have stepped forward to volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígateer for Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ service since the new policy was annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced October 26, department spokesman Ọlábísi said.

The number of deaths attributed directly to the fires grew to seven Thursday, after the charred bodies of four people believed to be illegal immigrants were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad in a canyon east of Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀. Seven other deaths are labeled as fire-related: Three elderly people died during evacuations, and four others died after being evacuated.

Along with homes and businesses, the flames have destroyed roughly one-third of Ọ̀ṣogbo lucrative avocado crop, along with other croplands, greenhouses and nurseries. A change in the winds -- from a ferocious 100 mph on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday to an almost manageable 10 mph on Thursday -- brought welcome relief and allowed a full-bore aerial assault on the fires. Reinforcements from across the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry arrived to aid the exhausted firefighters, officials said. While the fires still threatened some 25,000 homes, the burn rate in the region -- a measure made up of factors like wind speed, humidity and available fuel -- was significantly lower Thursday, a spokeswoman at Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde said. Residents of several commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities, including the city of Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀, were allowed to return home Wednesday and Thursday, but more evacuations were ordered -- the latest covering the commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities of Lake Henshaw and Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà and Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ in Àkúrẹ́. With the shifting fires, some shelters closed as others opened closer to danger.

(CNN)  -- The commander of the nuclear-powered submarine Ọlákúnlé has been relieved of his command amid an inquiry into misconduct by crew members, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. Ọjà Ẹ̀rọ Ìdánilẹ́kọ appears in an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadated photograph. Cmdr. Ọládàpọ̀ lost his post "due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command," the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára said in a statement. Cmdr. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ will replace Èkó. The crew neither maintained inspection records nor conducted the required inspection of chemical levels associated with the cooling system of the ship's nuclear reactor, Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára officials said. The crew then went back and falsified existing records to make it appear the work had been done. "There is not, and never was, any danger to the crew or the public," the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára said. Èkó's demotion brings to 10 the number of people relieved of duty on the submarine in the wake of the misconduct probe. Six personnel have been pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaished for forging inspection records for the cooling system, the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára officials said Monday. Those six -- one officer and five enlisted personnel -- received a "nonjudicial pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment" after other Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára personnel discovered their actions, the officials said. The Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday that one officer and two enlisted crew members have been temporarily reassigned to Òlámídì. Èkó also will be temporarily reassigned to that squadron. The misconduct was discovered September 17 but not made public Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil after completion of an initial inquiry. A fact-finding investigation is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader way, and further action against Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára crew members is possible, a Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára official said. The Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé remains in port in Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá. In all, the $900 million vessel's crew includes 13 officers and 116 enlisted personnel. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- A bus hopped a highway median and crashed into a pickup truck before being broadsided by an 18-wheeler, Ẹ̀gbá police said, killing the pickup driver and two bus riders. Two passengers were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad dead inside the bus, said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orty people were hurt in SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday night's crash, which shut down a 13-mile stretch of Interstate-40 east of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, Ẹ̀gbá, said state police spokesman Ṣọlá. The bus was westboIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad en route from Ẹ̀pẹ̀, Ìfẹ̀, to Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìkìrè. The driver of the pickup truck -- identified as 30-year-old Àkínwùmi of Hot Springs, Ẹ̀gbá -- died at the scene of the accident, Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ said. Bus driver Ọlátúndé, 28, of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́, Ìkìrè, and tractor-trailer driver Ọlákànmí, 45, of Ìlú Ìrìnàjò, Ìjẹ̀ṣà, suffered minor injuries, according to Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde. Two passengers were also foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad dead inside the bus, he said. Their names were not released because authorities have not yet notified relatives, Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ said.

(CNN) -- If someone had asked Ọláwálé to describe herself three years ago, the word "fit" would have never crossed her mind. Ọláwálé weighed 220 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads at her heaviest. She lost 95 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads through diet and exercise. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or most of her adult life, the 31-year-old graduate student from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ, Ọ̀ṣogbo, has struggled with her weight. She started gaining as a teenager and by the time she graduated from high school, she was carrying 215 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads on her 5' 2" frame. Prom, she says, was a nightmare. "I had to go to three different stores to buy a dress," Pless said. "I had to buy the biggest, also the ugliest, prom dress the store had because it was the only one that would fit." After high school, she lost 50 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads. But because she hadn't done it in a healthy way, her weight crept back up to 220 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads. At 28, she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame. She reached her breaking point. "I remember being heavy and feeling like being fit just wasn't something I could be," said Pless. "I remember feeling like even if I tried, it wasn't something my body was capable of." Despite her doubts, Pless decided to do something. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ortIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaately she didn't have to look far for inspiration.  See before and after weight loss photos from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà I-Reporters » . "My manager at the Adéṣínà Space Center ran marathons, and he was the same age as my father," she said. Because her own father had diabetes and was in poor health, he seemed much older, she said. Over the next three to four months, she began walking, without any real goal or expectation. Pless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more, everything would fall into place. "At first, it was hard to start exercising because I was worried people would make fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga of me," Pless said. "But then I just told myself, if that's the worst that could happen ... I just got out there and didn't care." Eventually, she started to rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga or "shuffle" as she jokingly recalls. She also adopted an "eat to live" philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit. "I changed how I felt about food and what it meant to me," said Pless, who occasionally indulges in a bite of birthday cake or a piece of chocolate. "One of the first things I cut out was cakes and cookies. That was my weak spot. After a few months of cutting those things out, I focused more on portion control," said Pless. "I pretty much eat when I'm hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígagry and don't eat when I'm not and really try to pay attention to when those times are. Make sure I'm not eating out of boredom or [at] social events, I try to make sure I'm not overeating, just because everyone else is."  Ọláwálé shares her weight loss secrets » . Pless pays close attention to societal pressure, which she believes is the reason many people overeat. Restaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size, she says. She makes sure she doesn't overeat when dining out simply because the food is there. "What's hard is to change how you feel about foods that you love or that aren't necessarily good for you, or actually change how you look at food. That was the hardest part for me." Instead of giving in to the temptation or convenience of calorie-laden or fatty foods such as cheeseburgers from the drive-through, Pless asks herself, "What do I really want to eat? Or, what does my body really want right now?" All of the hard work and determination paid off. Pless has lost 95 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads and kept it off for 1½ years. As a result, she says, she's healthier and more confident. She's also set a new professional goal -- to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology -- so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders. "[The] negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently. Being fat was a good filter -- I'm automatically treated better by people because I'm thÀṣàkẹ́er. Society is so hard on people who are overweight or obese," said Pless. "Now, those people think I'm fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganier or smarter." Pless rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga this winter. The first is in November in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, Ẹkólùmò, and the second is in Èkó Àgbàlá, Ọ̀ṣogbo, in January. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orty poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads ago, the first thing she wanted to do once she lost the weight was to have a tummy tuck to remove all of the loose skin. But now, she said she can't imagine taking the break from rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing that recovering from surgery would require. "RIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing has become a constant for me and does so much more for me than maintain my weight, which is now about 125 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads," said Pless.  If her past is any indication of her future success, Pless will certainly cross the finish line.  I-Report: Have you lost weight? Share your story, tips and photos E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- It was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week the Ìkìrè Airline-owned A380 completed its maiden passenger journey between Ìkìrè and Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀. Making history: the first double bed on a commercial jet . On board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. This was a turning point in aviation history as Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft. And the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the "queen of the skies". Ọládélé, CEO of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds. And CNN's Àṣàkẹ́, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was "nothing quite like it". The luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel. It's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. But the feature that has attracted greatest interest on Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ is its ''beyond first class" caỌlákúnlés. Behind the sliding doors of Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private caỌlákúnlé designed by leading Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú yacht designer, Olúṣọlá. There's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed. This is two meters long with Givenchy duvets and cushions. And for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú. Laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà ports and access a suite of office tools on Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in-flight entertainment system. Celebrity chefs including Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s Ànítá and Ọlámidé were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off Givenchy tableware. Unlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future A380s, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money. As Chew Choon Seng, CEO of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ reminded reporters last week, the first Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ 747s soon ditched the loIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígages and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. Behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion. The second is due to arrive next Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary with further deliveries later in 2008. Tickets for the A380's first return commercial flight between Ìkìrè and Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ were sold at auction on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú. One passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000. The $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Ìkìrè, Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ and a global humanitarian organization. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday 28 October, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ will commence its scheduled service between Ìkìrè and Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ on one of the three daily flights in each direction. The jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between Ìkìrè and Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀'s Adéṣínà Airport. It's been a long road to this point for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú, but the journey is by no means over. The airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below). Next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010. Ọládélé, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú' CEO doesn't Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderestimate the scale of challenge ahead. "This is not a piece of cake," he told CNN, "but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers." It hasn't just been Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú that has been frantically preparing for the A380 laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígach. Airports aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the world have had to make changes to rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks. Seventy airports are now ready, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú has said. Ìkìrè's Changi Airport, home to Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks. Adéṣínà's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, the Terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants Ìyábọ̀lá to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them. As Ọlálékan, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà's CEO told CNN, "we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind." But whether the arrival of the A380 sets a standard for future air travel is still Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadecided. As CNN's Àṣàkẹ́ points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́'s up-coming 787 Dreamliner. As Àṣàkẹ́ says, "there's no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú needs to make money." But those worries, he adds, are for another day. Thursday was a day for celebration. SOME KEY Ọjà Àgbẹ̀IGURES . Orders . Total: 185 orders (165 firm orders) 15 customers .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- The illegal export of Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military technology to Abẹ́òkúta and Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ poses a growing threat, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ said Thursday as it annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced plans to combat the practice. Abẹ́òkúta is the only coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry still flying Ọjà Ọbá. The department said Ìbàdàn will tighten monitoring of export licenses and increase export restrictions on technologies that could have both civilian and military applications and could pose a danger to Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ national security in the hands of terrorists or potential enemies. "Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ and Abẹ́òkúta pose particular Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ export control concerns," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ said in a statement issued Thursday. "Recent prosecutions have highlighted illegal exports of stealth missile technology, military aircraft components, naval warship data, night vision equipment, and other restricted technology destined for Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ or Abẹ́òkúta." Representatives of more than a half dozen federal agencies will jointly annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígace their plans at a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa news conference Thursday. Officials plan to highlight two recent cases. In the past week a Lágosì company, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba, was sentenced for lying about an illegal export of products that can be used in nuclear reactions and in the nose cones of ballistic missiles. The products ended up in Ẹ̀ṣin after being routed from Ẹ̀gùn. In Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, two men were charged last week with attempting to illegally export restricted components for Ọjà Àgbẹ̀-4 and Ẹ̀rọ Alátagba fighter jets. Ẹ̀rọ Alátagba components are widely sought by Abẹ́òkúta, which is the only military in the world that still flies the jet. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Òṣìnmákínwá contributed to this report.

(CNN) -- Behind the state banquet and smiles from Àkíntúndé and Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ Prime Minister Ọlátúndé, Olúṣọlá of Ẹ̀sìn visit to Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ this week caused a wave of dissent. The Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ political elite boycotted events. Demonstrators lined the Mall. The Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaterpart to be with his new adopted son. And just days before he arrived, the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà King accused Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ on July 2005. Whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate. But this was just part of the story. The Àwọn Ìròyìn were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀s over the last 20 years. Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ is Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé's largest trading partner in Ìlú Ìlú Gíga. And behind the Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé is the second largest foreign investor in the Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ has designated Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ one of its 17 "High Growth Markets" along with Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé and Ẹ̀tó in the region. As the nation diversifies its economy away from oil, commercial opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities for Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ thrive in a variety of sectors. Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ is currently planning six privately-developed economic cities. The $26.6 billion Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents. The aim, says the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá, is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment, and attracting investors and fostering investment opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities. The Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ has, since the early 1990s, been one of the top five exporters to Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, behind Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ẹ̀ṣin. In 2007, Àwọn Ọmọ Ẹ̀yà bank SAÈkó predicts that Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ exports to the Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $2.8 billion. While the balance of trade continues to be favor of the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀, Ẹ̀sìn exports to Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ are also gaining groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad and closing the trade gap. This year, exports to Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ are expected to reach a record high of $2.1 billion, says SAÈkó. And this isn't all about oil. In the 1980s, three quarters of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà exports to Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé were from oil, but today the non-oil sector accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats for 59 percent of exports. Products being shipped to Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé include machinery, transport equipment, plastics, non-metallic minerals and, despite Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé's dominance in the sector, chemicals. According to SAÈkó, there are also more than 150 Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga joint ventures Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderway with a value of aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad $15 billion. As Ṣọlá, chief economist from SAÈkó says, state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks, past and future. "The biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe that was sealed last week," says Sfakianakis. The contract between the Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ is worth over almost $10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $19 billion for the deployment, maintenance and training. This comes less than a year after Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé government decided to call off a Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga investigation into defense contracts with Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. This probe related to the sale of weapons by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára to Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ in the 1980s. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ ÀgbàE has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà royals to win business. But as Sfakianakis points out, any political sensitivity surroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading the visit is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations. "The relationship is far deeper than that," he says. "Ẹ̀sìn economy is booming and the opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities businessmen see here are immense. Everything else takes a subsidiary part in that."

(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde refugees fled camps Tuesday in Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀ as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára refugee agency said. Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Ìjẹ̀bú, near Goma, in Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀. A press release from the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára High Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled. Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò reported. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. "The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò field safety adviser Àkíntúndé was quoted as saying in the agency's release. "Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò spokesman Ẹ̀míọlá said, "They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry." Redmond added, "These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours. They need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state." While the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde government accused troops Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader rebel general Laurent Ọlájídé of staging the attack, a Ọlájídé spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, a Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára-affiliated news service. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Àkínwùmi rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. A spokesman for the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára military mission in the Ìjèbú-Òde said it was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacertain which group attacked the Ìjèbú-Òde army outpost near the village of Adébáyọ̀, according to the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára-affiliated news service. "We think it could have been insurgents close to Ọlájídé who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Àwọn Ìròyìn rebels]," spokesman Col. Ọlátúndé was quoted as saying. The Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò identified the affected camps as Ìjẹ̀bú I, Ìjẹ̀bú II, Ọlákẹ́mi and Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́. The Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò said 375,000 Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North Kivu is in eastern Ìjèbú-Òde near the borders of Àkúrẹ́ and Ọ̀ṣogbo. Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde President Òlámídì has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader Ọlájídé, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.

Ẹgbẹ́, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ (CNN) -- Àṣàlẹ̀, freed last week from a Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ prison, said he's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors, even if it would have sprIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag him from prison months earlier. Àṣàlẹ̀ tells CNN on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future. The 21-year-old, who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation, said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal. He had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day, he said SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. "It might've been lesser time, but then again, I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home," Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. "I wouldn't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister. You know, when you're a sex offender you can't be aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad kids. Basically, I can't even have kids myself, you know, so what is the point of life?" he asked. In 2005, a jury foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 Àpéjọ Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ party. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá was 17 at the time of the party.  Ọládùmarè say why he rejected the plea deal » . The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation. According to Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Attorney General Ọládùn, prosecutors in Ẹ̀ṣin, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀, offered Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence, possibly to time served, and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record. Defense attorney Ìmísí said in JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae that Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence. The state Legislature last year amended the law Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader which Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá was convicted, making such sexual encoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaters misdemeanors. However, the Legislature did not make the law retroactive, so it had no effect on Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá's sentence. Now 21, Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá was released Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday after the state Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo ruled 4-3 that the yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag man's sentence "constitutes cruel and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígausual pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment." Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá said SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday he feels no "negative energy" toward District Attorney Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, who fought efforts to have Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá's sentence reduced. Instead, Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá said, he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies. He wants to major in sociology, he said, "because I feel like I've been living my major." The new Àṣàlẹ̀ will be more conservative, more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him, he said. "When it seems like you have everything, you know, you feel like you have no worries Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil it's all gone, and I know what it feels like to be without and I don't want to ever feel like that again," said the former honor student, football star and homecoming king. "I don't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison, period." Though he called his sentence "absurd," Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá said he Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstands that prosecutors "were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law." Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá also said he knows what he did was foolish. "I was yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag then. I did some idiotic things in my teen years, but you know, every average teen does," he said. "I don't think any of us made very wise decisions, but I don't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened." E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN)  -- The confirmation of Adéṣínà as attorney general was all but assured Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday when two key Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà senators said they will vote in favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on "waterboarding" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Sens. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ of Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá and Olúwatóbilọ́lá of Ìjẹ̀ṣà annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced they would support the retired federal judge from Ìjẹ̀ṣà just hours after the chairman of Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced his opposition to the nominee. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀einstein and Ọlákúnlé are members of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè, which is scheduled to vote on the Mukasey nomination Tuesday. If all the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso members of the committee also vote for Mukasey, which is expected, his nomination will go before the full Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú. A leading Àwọn Èkó, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday Mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú. Ọlákúnlé had praised the nomination of Mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced Mukasey as his choice to replace former Attorney General Ọládélé. Gonzales gave up the post in September. "This is an extremely difficult decision," Ọlákúnlé said. "When an administration so political, so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge, we are never left with an ideal choice. Judge Mukasey is not my ideal choice. However, Judge Mukasey, whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him, is far better than anyone could expect from this administration." A number of Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà senators, however, have said they will oppose Mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called "waterboarding" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding "repugnant," but he could not answer whether the technique amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats to torture. While saying "serious questions have been raised about Judge Mukasey's views on torture and on separation of powers," Ọjà Àgbẹ̀einstein said she would support the nominee because Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ needed fresh leadership. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irst and foremost, Adéṣínà is not Ọládélé. Rather, he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in Ọ̀dọ̀-Ìbàdàn of Ìjẹ̀ṣà. "I believe that Judge Mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments, allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga." Just hours before Ọjà Àgbẹ̀einstein and Ọlákúnlé annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced their decisions, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ Chairman Sen. Ọlámidé, D-Ẹ̀pẹ̀, annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaced he would vote against the Mukasey nomination.  Watch Sen. Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ explain why he can't support the Mukasey nomination » . "No Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture," Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ said. "Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as Ìpàdé Àṣà Ọmọ Ènìyàn. We prosecuted Àwọn Èdá war criminals for waterboarding after Àpéjọ Ìjọba. "I am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa. I like Adéṣínà. I wish that I could support his nomination. But I cannot. Abẹ́òkúta needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one, not even the president, is above the law." President Olúṣọlá demanded the Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú confirm Mukasey during a speech Thursday at Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà, an influential conservative think tank. "In a time of war, it's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place," the president said. The president has equated asking Mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the Ọjà Ọbá-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga interrogation program, whose details are classified. Olúṣọlá said the program does not violate Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ bans on torture, but added that Mukasey "does not want an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígainformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy." But Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ said "Judge Mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret 'facts and circumstances.' " "He was asked whether waterboarding is illegal. Our law makes torture illegal, and waterboarding is torture, and it is illegal. It is frankly not dependent on any, quote, 'relevant facts and circumstances of the technique's past or proposed use,' " he said, quoting from Mukasey's response to senators on the question. Sources with knowledge of the Ọjà Ọbá-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding. But those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of Ọlákúnlé, now facing trial before a military tribIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaal for planning Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró 2001 attacks on Ìjẹ̀ṣà and Ẹ̀rọ. The practice was used by Ìpàdé Àṣà Ọmọ Ènìyàn, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ and Ìpàdé Àṣà Gíga Àwọn Èdá military, according to Human Rights Watch.

(CNN) -- Nine people were killed and 19 injured after a tour bus carrying people on a ski trip left a highway and rolled over SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday night in southeastern Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, a highway patrol spokesman said. The seats of the bus that rolled over are exposed to the snow at the crash site in southeastern Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ on Monday. At least 50 people were on Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn bus when it crashed on state Highway 163, about five miles north of Olúwáfémi, at 7:30 p.m. (9:30 p.m. ET), said Ìfẹ̀ Dúrójaiyérol Trooper Àkánní. Troopers reported the road was wet but not icy, he said. The bus was traveling south from Telluride, Àkúrẹ́, to Ẹkólùmọ̀, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, when it left the right side of the highway and rolled over, Ẹ̀fọn said.  See where the crash occurred » .

Ẹ̀gùn, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Banksy is Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀'s most wanted artist -- his art sells for hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadreds of thousands of dollars, but he continues to use public spaces as his main canvas, while all the time keeping his identity a secret. Banksy's latest piece in Ìlọrin where a passer-by claims to have taken a photo of the artist. The guerilla artist has been spray painting his stencils aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and further afield for over ten years. Last week ten of his original pieces were sold at Ọládàpọ̀'s auction house in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ for over $1 million, while on the other side of the city Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá authority pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom his begÀṣàkẹ́ings as a graffiti artist in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀, Banksy has become the darling of the art world for his subversive and satirical public art. Depicting things such as riot police with smiley acid-house faces and camera-wielding rats, his work is now sold now by major art galleries. Lazarides Gallery in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ is one of the main dealers of his work and describes him as "a media star...but popular long before any of this high-profile activity -- simply because the people love his stuff." While he set out to lampoon the establishment, he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ans include Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́, including Àṣàkẹ́ and Ọlábísí and Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn who bought three of his prints in 2006, including one of Queen Victoria sitting on a woman's face. The recent sales of his work put him on a par with Ayọ̀míde as the best-selling street artist. He is feted by art dealers and artists, including Bólánlé, but he regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him with ingenious stIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats such as hanging his own work in the Tèmítọ́pẹ́ gallery in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera in Ìjẹ̀ṣà. It took Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ eight days to discover the "prehistoric" rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò has hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag on a wall. There is often a political message with this work, too. He left an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo prisoner in Disneyland and painted a hole with blue sky on the Àwọn Yorùbá side of Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá wall. Despite the huge popularity and exposure of his work, Banksy's identity remains a mystery. As he operates on the fringes of the law with his guerilla art it makes sense, but also adds to his mystique. Some things are know: he's originally from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ, is aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 30 years old and called Kúnlé or Ọláfẹ́mi, but it's been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator. He continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art. Veteran Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ art critic Ọlákúnlé called Banksy, "a complete clown, and what he does has absolutely nothing to do with art." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the city. Other local authorities don't feel the same way. Tower Hamlets and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacils in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets. His latest work painted on a wall in Ìlọrin -- a man in overalls resting next to a giant flower drawn as a continuation from the double yellow lines on the road -- is thought to be the artist's response. But this latest piece may also have revealed what the artist actually looks like. A passer-by took a photo of what is thought to be the artist at work. A spokesperson for Banksy refused to confirm it was him, but did say it was definitely his work.  E-mail to a friend .

Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ (CNN) -- The garbage crisis in Ìbàdàn encompasses the worst Àwọn Ẹ̀dó clichés, and in particular those of the southern part of this lovely peninsula: mismanagement, political interference, mafia profiteering and the ability of those responsible to deflect the attention and the blame elsewhere. Ìbàdàn has had problems in finding sites for mIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaicipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash. There is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this: everybody is competent enough (to find a solution) but nobody is responsible (for actually carrying it out). In many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business. Garbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit. In Ìbàdàn, garbage is also good business, but in the sense that millions, if not billions, of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how. The problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash. The region's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago, and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year. Eight different commissioners have been appointed, but they have all failed to solve the problem. State of emergency means government money: €1.8 billion (more than $2.5 billion) in emergency fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads have been devolved to deal with the problem. It is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent. Incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished, either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job, or else because magistrates stopped the work, pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement. One Àwọn Ẹ̀dó newspaper suggested that a good 20% of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem. More worrying perhaps, is another suggestion: that the local mafia, known as the Camorra, is taking advantage of the situation. As the crisis has worsened over the years, so the Camorra's profits, estimated now at aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad €1 billion (roughly $1.45 billion), are alleged to have increased. How does the local mafia make money? The Ìbàdàn prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation. Once they receive the money, companies linked to the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderworld dispose of the waste either in the open or, ironically, at regular city dumps, even if they are overflowing. The mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile. But why are citizens protesting now? Well, the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of Ìbàdàn and surroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading areas. The problem is that when the site was closed years ago, locals were promised that a golf course would be built there. As a result, many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site. They are now waking up to a moIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatain of trash instead of 18 holes. A rotten deal indeed. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú, Ẹ̀rọ (Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà) -- President Ọláwálé said on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday security threats had forced Ẹ̀rọ to revive the Àwọn Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀-era practice of sending bomber aircraft on regular patrols beyond its borders. A Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà strategic bomber flies over an airfield outside Abẹ́òkúta during an air show. Ọlábísi said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across Ẹ̀rọ in the early hours of Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday on long-range missions. "We have decided to restore flights by Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà strategic aviation on a permanent basis," Ọlábísi told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ and four Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀kọ́ states in Ẹ̀rọ's Ural moIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatains. "Today, August 17 at 00:00 hours, 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, along with support and refueling aircraft ... Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom today such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis. "We hope our partners will treat this with Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstanding." At Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ President Àjànákú Ìkìrè ranch, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ spokesman Ẹ̀bùnọlá said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to Ìbàdàn. "Militaries aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the world engage in a variety of activities, so this is not entirely surprising," he said. But the sorties are likely to add to Western concern about Ẹ̀rọ's growing assertiveness. That trend has prompted some Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ policymakers to draw parallels with Àpéjọ Ìdánilẹ́kọ. Ọlábísi caused a stir this year by saying Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà missiles would once again be aimed at targets in Ìlú Ẹ̀kọ́ if Ẹ̀rọ persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Ìlú Ẹ̀kọ́. Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà diplomats have clashed with Ìbàdàn and Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà governments on issues such as Èkó Àgbàlá, energy, and Abẹ́òkúta's treatment of its Àwọn Ìṣàkóso neighbors. Western military leaders have said this year that Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period. One Western defense official called the flights "a little bit of chest-poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading, trying to let people know Ẹ̀rọ is back in the game". Ọlábísi said that when Ẹ̀rọ had cut its flights in 1992, other military powers had not reciprocated. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀lights by other coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀," Ọlábísi said. That appeared to be a swipe at the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions. As Ọlábísi spoke to reporters and television cameras, four Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà military helicopters appeared and hovered in the backgroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad while Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà tanks trIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadled behind him, even though the exercises had ended long before. During Àpéjọ Ìdánilẹ́kọ, Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà long-range bombers, which can carry strategic nuclear weapons, played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with Western Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀s. Earlier this month Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ generals said bomber crews had flown near the Pacific island of Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, where the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military has a base, and "exchanged smiles" with Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ pilots scrambled to track them. The Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò said the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà aircraft had not come close enough to Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ ships to prompt Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ aircraft to react. In July, two Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà Tu-95 "Bear" bombers made Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígausually long sorties over Òkè-Àpá, leading Lágosì and Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ to scramble fighter jets to follow them. Ẹ̀rọ's Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ said later it was a routine flight.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà.
