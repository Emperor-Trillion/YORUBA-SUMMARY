Ẹ̀gùn, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà) -- Ọlájídé star Ànítá gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Ànítá as Ọlájídé in "Ọlájídé and the Order of the Ẹkólùmọ̀" To the disappointment of gossip columnists aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the world, the yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. "I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar," he told an Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ interviewer earlier this month. "I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. "The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads -- books and CDs and DVDs." At 18, Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film "Hostel: Part II," currently six places below his number one movie on Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. "I'll definitely have some sort of party," he said in an interview. "Hopefully none of you will be reading about it." Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. "People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'" he told reporters last month. "But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them." His latest outing as the boy wizard in "Ọlájídé and the Order of the Ẹkólùmọ̀" is breaking records on both sides of the Ìlú Ọmọde and he will reprise the role in the last two films.

He will also appear in "December Boys," an Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Bólánlé "Equus." Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: "I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game," he told Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà. E-mail to a friend .

Editor's note: In our Ọjà Àṣà series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Adébáyọ̀ takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the "forgotten floor," where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Èkó Àgbàlá before trial. Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́, Ọ̀ṣogbo (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Ẹ̀sìn pretrial detention facility is dubbed the "forgotten floor." Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Ọládùn says are usually "avoidable felonies." He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Túbọ̀sún. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Túbọ̀sún. He is well known in Èkó Àgbàlá as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Túbọ̀sún says about one-third of all people in Ẹ̀sìn coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaty jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára. Túbọ̀sún tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígajust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Èkó Àgbàlá. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Túbọ̀sún says 200 years ago people were considered "lIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaatics" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígafit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Túbọ̀sún says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Túbọ̀sún says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the "forgotten floor"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment. Túbọ̀sún says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Túbọ̀sún says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Túbọ̀sún, justice is served. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀, Ìfẹ̀ (CNN) -- Drivers who were on the Ẹ̀tó bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. "The whole bridge from one side of the Ẹ̀pẹ̀ to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down," survivor Ọládàpọ̀ told CNN. "I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down." He said his back was injured but he determined he could move aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. "I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones."  Watch a driver describe his narrow escape » . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. Dúrójaiyé, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of Ìlú Ẹ̀pẹ̀, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígateers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. "I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling," BaỌlákúnléeau said. "It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies." BaỌlákúnléeau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. "I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall," he said. "So I stayed in my car Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. "I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabỌlákúnlég kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos." He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad and told them to rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries.

I felt that twice," Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. "I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car," she told Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo. "It's really very surreal." BaỌlákúnléeau told Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀: "On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. "My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive."

"I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die," he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Doctors removed five small polyps from President Olúṣọlá's colon on Saturday, and "none appeared worrisome," a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ spokesman said. The polyps were removed and sent to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára in Èkó Ìlú, Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Adéṣínà said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Olúṣọlá is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp Ọládàpọ̀. During the procedure Vice President Ẹ̀míọlá assumed presidential power. Olúṣọlá reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used "monitored anesthesia care," Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Ọládùmarè -- who is in Ọ̀yọ́, Ìkìrè, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Àwọn Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ terriers, Barney and Ìbítọ́lá, Stanzel said. He planned to have lIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígach at Camp Ọládàpọ̀ and have briefings with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Adviser Ọláwálé and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Chief of Staff Ẹ̀bùnọlá, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon. Ọládélé, meanwhile, spent the morning at his home on Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀'s eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs, Stanzel said. Nothing occurred that required him to take official action as president before Olúṣọlá reclaimed presidential power. The procedure was supervised by Dr. Àkíntúndé, Olúṣọlá's physician, and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára in Èkó Ìlú, Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára said. Olúṣọlá's last colonoscopy was in JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae 2002, and no abnormalities were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ spokesman Ọlálékan said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday that Olúṣọlá had polyps removed during colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver.  Watch Snow talk about Olúṣọlá's procedure and his own colon cancer » . "The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance," Snow said.

(CNN)  -- Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ has indefinitely suspended Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú quarterback Ọláfẹ́mi without pay, officials with the league said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú star Ọláfẹ́mi is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Olúwáfémi admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Ìjẹ̀bú. "Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú, and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú fans have all been hurt by your actions," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú Commissioner Ọlákúnlé said in a letter to Olúwáfémi. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday with a federal court in Ìjẹ̀bú, Olúwáfémi also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣes owner Ọlátúndé said Olúwáfémi's admissions describe actions that are "incomprehensible and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaacceptable." The suspension makes "a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú will not be tolerated," he said in a statement.  Watch what led to Olúwáfémi's suspension » . Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá said the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣes could "assert any claims or remedies" to recover $22 million of Olúwáfémi's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004, according to Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde. Olúwáfémi said he would plead guilty to one coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of "Conspiracy to Travel in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ighting Venture" in a plea agreement filed at Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ in Ọ̀ṣogbo, Ìjẹ̀bú. The charge is pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, "full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release," the plea deal said. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ederal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. "The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense," the plea agreement said. In an additional summary of facts, signed by Olúwáfémi and filed with the agreement, Olúwáfémi admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. "Most of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by Olúwáfémi," the official summary of facts said. Gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators Olúṣọlá, Adéọlá and sometimes Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́, it continued. "Olúwáfémi did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights. Olúwáfémi did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by 'Bad Newz Kennels.' " Olúwáfémi also agreed that "collective efforts" by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs. AroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad April, Olúwáfémi, Peace and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera tested some dogs in fighting sessions at Olúwáfémi's property in Ìjẹ̀bú, the statement said. "Peace, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera and Olúwáfémi agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in 'testing' sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning. "Olúwáfémi agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera and Olúwáfémi," the summary said. Peace, 35, of Ọ̀ṣogbo, Ìjẹ̀bú; Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera, 28, of Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀; and Ọlátúnjí, 34, of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé, Ìjẹ̀bú, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences. Olúwáfémi, 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge.  See a timeline of the case against Olúwáfémi » . The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The federal case against Olúwáfémi focused on the interstate conspiracy, but Olúwáfémi's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Ọlátúndé. "It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior," Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. "The risk for Olúwáfémi is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Ìjẹ̀bú could say, 'Hey, look, you admitted violating Ìjẹ̀bú state law as well. We're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court.' " In the plea deal, Olúwáfémi agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary. Olúwáfémi also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests. Olúwáfémi agreed to "make restitution for the full amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of the costs associated" with the dogs that are being held by the government. "Such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals." Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs. But the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Olúwáfémi and his admitted co-conspirators. Judge Òlámídì issued an order Thursday telling Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè to "arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property." Both the judge's order and Olúwáfémi's filing refer to "approximately" 53 pit bull dogs. After Olúwáfémi's indictment last month, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá ordered the quarterback not to report to the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣes training camp, and the league is reviewing the case. Blank told Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga on Monday he could not speculate on Olúwáfémi's future as a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe, at least not Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil he had seen "a statement of facts" in the case.

Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ (CNN) -- Dressed in a Superman shirt, 5-year-old Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ held his sister's hand Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday, seemingly Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaaware that millions of people across the world have been touched by his story. Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ holds his sister's hand Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde family could ever have imagined for their boy: Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ turns 6 next Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. "I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself," his mother, Ọlámidé, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. "I didn't think the reaction would be this big." His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. "We just want to thank everyone who has come forward," he said. "We knew there was kindness out there." Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀, leaving "no stone Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaturned" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé. He says he even put in a request to Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatable in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́'s case.  Watch CNN's Ọlákúnlé describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring » . Shortly after Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́'s story aired Wednesday, Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára -- a nonprofit organization based in Òṣìnmákínwá, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ and his family to come to Ìbàdàn and to set up a fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad for donations. You can make a donation at the foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the "general donation" area that is marked "Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́'s fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad." The foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Ayọ̀míde, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Àṣàkẹ́ who is donating his services for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́'s cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. "We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment," said Àkánní, executive director of Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára. "We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries." She added, "He will be getting the absolute best care that's available." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́'s parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in Abẹ́òkúta may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. "I will do anything for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́," his father said, pulling his son closer to him. "Our child is everything." His mother tried to coax Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border.

Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ (CNN) -- The women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used. They have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $8 a day. Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, 37, is a mother of three. She says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home. "People shouldn't criticize women, or talk badly about them," says 37-year-old Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves. "They all say we have lost our way, but they never ask why we had to take this path." A mother of three, she wears light makeup, a gold pendant of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad her neck, and an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaexpected air of elegance about her. "I don't have money to take my kid to the doctor. I have to do anything that I can to preserve my child, because I am a mother," she says, explaining why she prostitutes herself. Anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks. "No matter what else I may be, no matter how off the path I may be, I am a mother!"  Watch a woman describe turning to prostitution to "save my child" » . Her clasped hands clench and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaclench nervously. Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà's husband thinks that she is cleaning houses when she goes away. So does Karima's family. "At the start I was cleaning homes, but I wasn't making much. No matter how hard I worked it just wasn't enough," she says. Karima, clad in all black, adds, "My husband died of lIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing." She has five children, ages 8 to 17. Her eldest son could work, but she's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets, preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child. She was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office. "They took advantage of me," she says softly. "At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it." Both Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà and Karima have clients that call them a couple times a week. Other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients. Or they flag down vehicles. Prostitution is a choice more and more Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde women are making just to survive. "It's increasing," Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà says. "I foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad this 'thing' through my friend, and I have another friend in the same predicament as mine. Because of the circumstance, she is forced to do such things." Violence, increased cost of living, and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options, according to humanitarian workers. "At this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive," says Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀, head and foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader of Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. "It's a taboo that no one is speaking about." She adds, "There is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies, their souls and they lost it all. It crushes us to see them, but we have to work on it and that's why we started our team of women activists." Her team poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads the streets of Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward. "Most of the women that we find at hospitals [who] have tried to commit suicide" have been involved in prostitution, said Basma Rahim, a member of Mohammed's team. The team's aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s political parties -- to have them, as Mohammed puts it, "come tell us what [they] are ... going to do about this." Rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad who lives in a room with three of her children: "She has sex while her three children are in the room, but she makes them stand in separate corners." According to Rahim and Mohammed, most of the women they encoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígater say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaforgiving circumstances in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. "They took this path but they are not pleased," Rahim says. Karima says when she sees her children with food on the table, she is able to convince herself that it's worth it. "Everything is for the children. They are the beauty in life and, without them, we cannot live." But she says, "I would never allow my daughter to do this. I would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this." Karima's last happy memory is of her late husband, when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today's Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ together. Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà says as a yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag girl she dreamed of being a doctor, with her mom boasting about her potential in that career. Life couldn't have taken her further from that dream. "It's not like we were born into this, nor was it ever in my blood," she says. What she does for her family to survive now eats away at her. "I lay on my pillow and my brain is spÀṣàkẹ́ing, and it all comes back to me as if I am watching a movie." E-mail to a friend .

Ọjà Àgbẹ̀lanked by Snow and Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀ in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. "It's been a joy to watch him spar with you," Olúṣọlá told reporters.  Watch the annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacement about Snow leaving » . Olúṣọlá said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. "He'll battle cancer and win," Olúṣọlá said, "and he'll be a solid contributor to society." Turning to Snow, the president then said: "I love you, and I wish you all the best." Snow, speaking after Olúṣọlá at the start of the daily Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú. According to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, Snow makes $168,000 as Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, "and that loan is now gone." "This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga and satisfaction," Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do "some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties." Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 2005.

Snow had been an anchor for "Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday" and a political analyst for Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted "The Ọlálékan Show" on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the cancer has not spread. "The tumors are stable -- they are not growing," Snow said of the results from an MRI and a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò scan. "And there are no new growths. The health is good." The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. "I'm also putting on weight again," he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. "I actually feel very good about" the health situation. Snow said on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- Police and Ọjà Ọbá agents are investigating the discovery of an empty rocket laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacher tube on the front lawn of Ìbàdàn, Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá, home, Ọjà Ọbá spokesman Ìmísí said. Niranjan Desai discovered the 20-year-old AT4 anti-tank rocket laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacher tube, a one-time-use device, lying on her lawn Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday morning, police said. The laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacher has been turned over to Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò officials at Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá, an explosive ordnance disposal Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígait, at Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ort Monmouth, Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ officials said. The laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacher "is no longer operable and not considered to be a hazard to public safety," police said, adding there was no indication the laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacher had been fired recently. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ officials said they could not determine if the laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacher had been fired, but indicated they should know once they find out where it came from. The nearest military base, Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ort Dix, is more than 70 miles from Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́. The Joint Terrorism Task Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orce division of the Ọjà Ọbá and Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ police are investigating the origin of the rocket laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacher and the circumstance that led to its appearance on residential property. "Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú doesn't leave a rocket laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacher on the lawn of middle-aged ladies," said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi of Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà. A neighbor, Ṣọlá, said the object lying on Desai's lawn looked military, was brown, had a handle and strap, and "both ends were open, like you could shoot something with it." QuÀṣàkẹ́ also said the device had a picture of a soldier on it and was 3 to 4 feet long. An Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ official said the device is basically a shoulder-fired, direct-fire weapon used against groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad targets -- a modern-day bazooka -- and it is not wire-guided. According to the Web site Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè, a loaded M136 AT4 anti-tank weapon has a 40-inch-long fiberglass-wrapped tube and weighs just 4 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads. Its 84 millimeter shaped-charge missile can penetrate 14 inches of armor from a maximum of 985 feet. It is used once and discarded. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- As he awaits a crucial progress report on Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, President Olúṣọlá will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Ẹ̀tó by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out. President Olúṣọlá pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the  Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ọlọ́rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Leaders summit in Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá. On Wednesday in Ẹ̀gùn, Ìṣẹ̀dó, Olúṣọlá will tell members of Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró that "then, as now, people argued that the real problem was Abẹ́òkúta's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end," according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára. "Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into Ìpàdé Àjọ Òṣèlú and how we left," Olúṣọlá will say. "Whatever your position in that debate, one Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígamistakable legacy of Ẹ̀tó is that the price of Abẹ́òkúta's withdrawal was paid by millions of Àṣàkẹ́ocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' " the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Ẹ̀tó emboldened today's terrorists by compromising Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ credibility, citing a quote from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá leader Olúwáfémi that the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people would rise against Àjọyọ̀ Ìbílẹ̀ the same way they rose against the war in Ẹ̀tó, according to the excerpts. "Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Ẹ̀tó carried no price to Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ credibility, but the terrorists see things differently," Olúṣọlá will say. On Tuesday, Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú Majority Leader Ọlákúnlé said, "President Olúṣọlá's attempt to compare the war in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ to past military conflicts in Ìlú-Ọ̀rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga ignores the fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaders in our history. "While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, paid for by the taxpayers, Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde government. It is time to change direction in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, and Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga will again work to do so in the fall." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe is billing the speech, along with another address next week to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde, as an effort to "provide broader context" for the debate over the upcoming Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ progress report by Gen. Olúwatóbilọ́lá, the top Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military commander, and Ayọ̀míde, the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ ambassador in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀. President Olúṣọlá has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people -- to withhold judgment on his troop "surge" in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil the report comes out in September.  Olúwáfémi criticize the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde government » . It is being closely watched on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, particularly by Àwọn Ẹ̀ka nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígapopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Olúwatóbilọ́lá said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ troops in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ might begin. Olúṣọlá's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára to try to reframe the debate over Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad that almost two-thirds of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga -- 64 percent -- now oppose Àjọyọ̀ Ìbílẹ̀, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion. The poll also foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. In addition to his analogy to Ẹ̀tó, Olúṣọlá in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Ìlú Ọmọ Ènìyàn, including the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ defeat and occupation of Ẹ̀ṣin after Àpéjọ Ìjọba and Ìpàdé Ẹ̀sìn Ọlọ́rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. "In the aftermath of Ẹ̀ṣin's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Àwọn Èdá transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom," Olúṣọlá will say. "Today, in defiance of the critics, Ẹ̀ṣin ... stands as one of the world's great free societies." Speaking about Ìpàdé Ẹ̀sìn Ọlọ́rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, Olúṣọlá will note that at the time "critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that Abẹ́òkúta's intervention was divisive here at home." "While it is true that Ìpàdé Ẹ̀sìn Ọlọ́rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga had its share of challenges, Abẹ́òkúta never broke its word," Olúṣọlá will say. "Without Abẹ́òkúta's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá after the war, millions of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ọdọ́ would now be living Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader a brutal and repressive regime."

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Vice President Ẹ̀míọlá will serve as acting president briefly Saturday while President Olúṣọlá is anesthetized for a routine colonoscopy, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ spokesman Ọlálékan said Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday.

Ẹ̀fọn, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá (CNN)  -- A magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook the Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ area Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday at 4:42 a.m. PT (7:42 a.m. ET), Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá reported. The quake left about 2,000 customers without power, said Túbọ̀sún, a spokesman for Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé and Light. Under the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ classification, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake is considered "light," which it says usually causes minimal damage. "We had quite a spike in calls, mostly calls of inquiry, none of any injury, none of any damage that was reported," said Capt. Ọládélé of the Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ police. "It was fairly mild."  Watch police describe concerned calls immediately after the quake » . The quake was centered about two miles east-northeast of Ẹ̀rọ, at a depth of 3.6 miles, the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ said. Ẹ̀rọ is just east of Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀, across Ìlú Ẹ̀kólùmò. An Ẹ̀rọ police dispatcher told CNN the quake set off alarms at people's homes. The shaking lasted about 50 seconds, said CNN meteorologist Ọlátúndé. According to the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀, magnitude 4.2 quakes are felt indoors and may break dishes and windows and overturn Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígastable objects. Pendulum clocks may stop.

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- There is "no remaining hope" of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ coal mine alive, a federal official said Saturday. Ọlájídé holds a candle and sings during a fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadraiser for miners Tuesday in Price, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. "Over the past 25 days, Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga has exhausted all known options in our attempt to reach the six miners," Ẹ̀míọlá, head of the agency, said in a statement. "The thoughts and prayers of the dedicated professionals at Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò are with the families." Sympathy for the failed efforts also came Saturday from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára. "Last night, a difficult decision was made to end the search," President Olúṣọlá said in a statement. "Ọlábísi and I are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ Secretary Àṣàlẹ̀ called the ordeal "heartbreaking." "The grueling aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity, and our thoughts and prayers are with them all," Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ said in a statement. After drilling seven holes into mine tIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganels from the moIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígataintop above, there has been no sign of the miners -- and microphones have picked up no soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad from the men.  See a timeline of rescue efforts » . Tests showed Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ GígadergroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life. "We basically told the families that at this point in time we've rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga out of options," Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn said at a news conference late Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday. "We've consulted with the people that we have here, we've consulted with the technical support in Lágosì and we've consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go," he said. "And basically, through all the information we've gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, in terms of the air readings we foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad down there and ... everything else, we just don't know where else we can put a hole to get any other information."  See photos of the rescue mission » . There were no public statements Saturday from Àjànákú, president and CEO of Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, co-owner of Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ederal officials became the spokesmen. No one from Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga was present at Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday's news conference. "They are done. It's finished," the attorney for the families said, according to the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ílíìmù Ọmọ Ènìyàn. "It's a hard and bitter pill for our families, and there were quite a few tears shed," the newspaper quotes Àkínwùmi as saying. The men were trapped during a collapse on August 6, and it is not known whether they survived the cave-in. Efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed, and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working. Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad at the sixth hole. Under pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀amilies wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule. The effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called "a long shot" by an official. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò's Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn said that hole was drilled into Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it. Work resumed Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday, this time at the fourth hole, but the camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said. "Basically, what it saw was really not that much. There was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole. It really couldn't go any farther than seven feet," he said of the latest try. In addition, the roof was sagging. "The families asked many, many questions and we answered them all the best we could, basically coming to the conclusion that we had rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga out of options." Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Ọládàpọ̀ mine. "I will never come back to that evil moIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatain," he said. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riends and family have identified the six missing miners as Ọlákànmí, Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi, Dúrójaiyé, Bólánlé, Ọlábísí and Ọlámidé. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- At least 14 people were killed and 60 others woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded Thursday when a bomb ripped through a crowd waiting to see Ẹgbẹ́'s president in Batna, east of the capital of Algiers, Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ reported. A woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded person gets first aid shortly after Thursday's attack in Batna, Ẹgbẹ́. The explosion occurred at 5 p.m. about 20 meters (65 feet) from a mosque in Batna, a town about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Algiers, security officials in Batna told the state-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga news agency. The bomb went off 15 minutes before the expected arrival of President Àkánní. It wasn't clear if the bomb was caused by a suicide bomber or if it was planted, the officials said. Later Thursday, Ẹgbẹ́'s Interior Minister Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ said "a suspect person who was among the crowd attempted to go beyond the security cordon," but the person escaped "immediately after the bomb exploded," the press service reported. Olúṣọlá made his visit to Batna as planned, adding a stop at a hospital to visit the woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded before he returned to the capital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bomỌlákúnlég. Ẹgbẹ́ faces a continuing Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ insurgency, according to the Ọjà Ọbá. In July, 33 people were killed in apparent suicide bomỌlákúnlégs in Algiers that were claimed by an Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá-affiliated group.

(CNN) -- A virus foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad in healthy Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across Ìbàdàn, researchers reported Thursday. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ bees walk on a moveable comb hive at Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, in Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀, Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in Ìbàdàn. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination. Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in Ìbàdàn in 2004, the same year Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ beekeepers started importing bees from Ẹ̀pẹ̀. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone. The virus identified in the healthy Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ bees is  Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ (Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa) -- named that because it was discovered by Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà researchers. Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa die close to the hive, after developing shivering wings and paralysis. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or some reason, the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ bees seem to be resistant to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa and do not come down with symptoms. Scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad that Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time. But the study released Thursday on Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ Web site, operated by the journal Science, cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors. "This research give us a very good lead to follow, but we do not believe Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa is acting alone," said Ọlákúnlé of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso and a co-author of the study. "Other stressors on the colony are likely involved." This could explain why bees in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ may be resistant to colony collapse. "There are no cases ... in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ at all," entomologist Ọládùmarè of Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú told Ìpàdé Ìṣàkóso Ọmọde last month. "It is a Ìlú Ìsọ̀kan phenomenon." Bee ecology expert and Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe professor Adébáyọ̀ said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time, pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors. Researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ mainland but are not foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad in Ẹ̀pẹ̀. Ọjà Ọbá researcher Ẹ̀bùnọlá said Thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope. "One nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind," said Delaplane, who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite. "But in the case of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder. This is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease- and pest-resistant." Bee researchers will now look for stresses that may comỌlákúnlée to kill bees. "The next step is to ascertain whether Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa, alone or in concert with other factors, can induce Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú [colony collapse disorder] in healthy bees," said Kúnlé, director of Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera. Besides the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde and Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn researchers, others involved in the study released Thursday include researchers from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀, Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá and 454 Life Sciences.
