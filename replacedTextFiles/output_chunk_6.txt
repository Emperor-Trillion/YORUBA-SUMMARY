Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ (CNN) -- None of the 1,000-plus Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde detainees freed in recent weeks have broken a pledge not to return to the insurgency, according to the Marine general who oversees the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ detention centers in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. A Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀. Speaking in Èdè Hausa, Maj. Gen. Adébáyọ̀ on Wednesday reassured Àwọn Tív about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Àwọn Ìpínlẹ̀ -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. Stone described the detention system as "open and transparent," saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ standards, educational opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities, jobs skills and contact with families. The Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Èkó Ìlú and in Camp Cropper near Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀ -- are political sore points for Àwọn Ìpínlẹ̀, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Àwọn Aláṣẹ political coalition -- Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀-led coalition laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígached Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú-led government. "This pledge is an Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde pledge, a pledge before an Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde judge, frequently with a family member present," Stone said. "I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde or coalition forces." Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Stone's description seems a far cry from the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi prison operated by the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. "There are no secrets that go on in detention," Stone said. "Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world."  See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls » . By the time of their release, "detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment," he said. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígager are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Èkó Ìlú, Ìjèbú-Òde, Abẹ́òkúta, Ìfẹ̀ and Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, he said. Other developments .

(CNN) -- Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà on Wednesday refused to modify or overturn a lower court's ruling allowing Kúnlé, convicted of killing her minister husband, visitation rights with the couple's three daughters. Holding baby Ànítá, Kúnlé stands next to Adébáyọ̀. In the foregroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad are Ọlákúnlé and Ṣọlá. Túbọ̀sún and Dúrójaiyé, parents of slain minister Ọlátúndé, had asked the court to intervene and either revoke Ọláwálé visitation rights or allow them to proceed only Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader supervision of a coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaselor. The children -- Ṣọlá, Ọlákúnlé and Ànítá -- have been living with their grandparents since their mother was arrested last year. Winkler has not seen the children in 15 months, said Àkíntúndé, her attorney. She said her client was "absolutely elated about the news and believes this will be her best Christmas ever." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe said she believes the visit may come before Christmas. A jury convicted Winkler earlier this year of volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatary manslaughter in the shotgIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga death of Ọlátúndé -- not the first-degree murder conviction prosecutors had wanted. She said the slaying came after years of abuse, including physical violence and being forced to dress "slutty" for Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadesirable sex acts. Winkler received a three-year sentence, but a judge required her to serve only 210 days, gave her credit for the five months she had already served and allowed her to serve the remaining 60 days in a mental health facility. She was released in August. At the time of their father's death in March 2006, Ṣọlá was 8, Ọlákúnlé was 6 and Ànítá was 1. Túbọ̀sún and Dúrójaiyé have moved to terminate Ọláwálé rights and have filed a $2 million wrongful death suit against her for their son's slaying. The termination issue has not been decided in court. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe said the court may want to determine what, if any, bond Winkler has with her children before making a decision. Attempts by CNN to contact attorneys for the Winklers were not immediately successful Wednesday. In September, a lower court granted Winkler visitation with her daughters pending the outcome of the custody battle. The court specified the visits be supervised by a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the children's interests and supervised by members of the couple Winkler is living with or by her sister. A subsequent appeal by the grandparents was denied, leading to their Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo appeal. The Winklers said if their former daughter-in-law got visitation with the children at all, it should be Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the supervision of a professional coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaselor. At a September hearing, according to court documents, they said the children "exhibit fear and confusion" toward their mother "and her role in their father's death." One expert, in testimony, quoted Ṣọlá as saying her mother had killed her father and, "I don't know if she will kill me. I want to ask her if she would do that to me. It scares me, kind of; if she did, well, I guess I would see my father." The Winklers also said that after telephone calls with their mother, the children experienced "urination accidents, sleeping problems, graphic nightmares and sleepwalking." They said the lower court erred by failing to appoint the guardian ad litem Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil after the September hearing. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe, however, said she believes terminating Winkler's parental rights would not be in the children's best interest. "She has a faith rarely seen, and she loves those children," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe said. After Ọlábísi death, Winkler fled with the girls to the Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ coast, where she was arrested. She said during a September appearance on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́" that she never expected to get away with killing her husband, but that she fled to be with her daughters and "have some good times."

LAHORE, Ẹ̀ṣin (CNN) -- Two Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ television networks that transmit from Èkó Àgbàlá in Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá were ordered off the air Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday at the request of Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ President Pervez Musharraf, officials from the networks said. Ẹ̀ṣin's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has been Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader pressure to lift a state of emergency. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà and ARY Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ offer a variety of programming, including news, entertainment, sports and music. Both networks had been banned from Ẹ̀ṣin's cable television system -- along with other networks, including CNN and Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà -- since Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3. This latest action prevents the two Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ networks from broadcasting worldwide via satellite. "This was basically our window to the world, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ President Ọlákúnlé said. "In Ẹ̀ṣin, we've been shut down since the 3rd." The action was not wholly Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaexpected, but surprising nevertheless, Ọlálékan said. "We uplink from Èkó Àgbàlá, never having had a license to uplink from Ẹ̀ṣin," he said. "Èkó Àgbàlá is a media city which seemed to be a haven and a sanctuary." Ọlálékan said network officials have been in discussions with Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ government officials and "it seemed very obvious that they were going to do this. We were ready for it to a certain extent." "Eventually they decided to put their feet on the pipe, as it were." The government has made numerous demands of the network, although none of them official, Ọlálékan said. "It's done through intermediaries," he said. "[Dulling] down the content, not having certain anchors, some of the hosts of our programs and talk shows." Musharraf's emergency order put several restrictions on the media, preventing journalists from expressing opinions prejudicial to "the ideology ... or integrity of Ẹ̀ṣin." Journalists are also restricted from covering suicide bomỌlákúnlégs and militant activity and could face three-year jail terms if they "ridicule" members of the government or armed forces. Almost a dozen journalists have been arrested. Musharraf has denied that his restrictions bar criticism, saying they only ask for responsibility in reporting. But last week, Ẹ̀ṣin expelled three print journalists for using language in an editorial that a Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ official called offensive to Musharraf. The editorial criticized Musharraf and Ìbàdàn and Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ for continuing to support him. While many Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ journalists have protested the restrictions, some smaller television channels have complied with the government's restrictions. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ and ARY have refused. "It seems most of the other channels have kowtowed in order to survive," Ọlálékan said. Musharraf has said the emergency order improves stability and will foster peaceful parliamentary elections, which he has said he would like to see take place before January 9. The exact date will be set by Ẹ̀ṣin's Election Commission. Opposition leaders have accused Musharraf of declaring emergency rule to keep his hold on power and avoid an expected court ruling that would have nullified his election victory in October.

Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, Ọ̀ṣogbo (CNN)   -- Ọjà Àgbẹ̀our people were killed and several injured after an explosion Wednesday at a chemical plant sent a thick plume of smoke over a section of Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, authorities said. A thick plume of smoke rises Wednesday at a chemical plant in Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, Ọ̀ṣogbo. "Literally, it's a hellish inferno. There is no other way to describe it," said Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára spokesman Ọlákẹ́mi. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ourteen people were hospitalized after the blast at the T2 Lab on Ọjà Àgbẹ̀aye Road, in an industrial area on the waterfront in north Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, Adéọlá said. Officials initially ordered an evacuation of nearby businesses, but by 4 p.m. the order had been lifted after tests of the air foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad no toxicity, Adéọlá said. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irefighters were still battling hot spots, and the effort will be going on for "quite some time," he said.  See an I-Report accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat about the blast » . Six of those injured were transported to Shands Hospital in Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, hospital spokeswoman Adéṣínà said. A Shands official said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo had been activated -- something done to put the staff in high alert in anticipation of trauma patients. A woman who answered the T2 Lab's 24-hour facility emergency phone said the plant manufactures ecotane, a gasoline additive that reduces tailpipe emissions, according to the laboratory's Web site.  See a map of the site of the explosion » . The billowing black smoke could be seen from the city's downtown, said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú reporter Àjànákú. Murphy said she talked to several workers as they walked out of the area, and they were "shaken to the core." "They described a hissing noise and then a soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad wave," she said. Ẹ̀bùnọlá was trying to get in touch with his son, who works in a plant in the area, but was having no luck reaching him on his cell phone. "He was shook up when he called me, but I can't get through to him anymore," Ọlákẹ́mi said. "I don't know if he's in the hospital or what." CNN I-Reporters Ọlámidé and his son Calvin, 16, shot pictures of the explosion. They felt the blast shake their home, about 15 minutes away, and went to see what was going on. Àṣàlẹ̀, 63, was working at home on Townsend Boulevard in Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ when a loud boom shook his house, he said. "It was a gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígashot-type explosion; it wasn't a rumble," he said. Túbọ̀sún, an insurance salesman, and his neighbor ran outside and noticed thick smoke billowing from the other side of the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde, which separates his neighborhood from the site of the blast. "The cloud that came out of it was white, some would say mushroom-shaped," Túbọ̀sún said. "It was followed by dark, dark smoke." E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- Òṣìnmákínwá is the CEO of Àwọn Hausa, a state-owned real estate investment company. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀amous for its purchase of Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀'s Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso, Àwọn Hausa was established in 2004 by Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà, to support Ẹ̀tó's growing economy and to co-ordinate the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's real estate development priorities. It is now valued at $1 billion with 18 projects Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderway. Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga is a graduate from Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ and was responsible for high profile projects such as Ìpàdé Àjọ Ẹ̀kọ́ and the promotion of private sector investment through public sector privatization. Before being appointed as CEO of Àwọn Hausa, Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga was at the office of the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irst Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Ọjà Àgbẹ̀oreign Affairs as technical advisor. He joins us on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba to talk about the vision for Ẹ̀tó, how Àwọn Hausa fits into it and its investments outside Gulf in Abẹ́òkúta, Ìfẹ̀, Èkó Ìlú, Ìjèbú-Òde and Ìlú Ẹ̀kọ́. With oil prices hitting $88 this week, Ìmísí begins by asking Òṣìnmákínwá about the differences he sees now compared to the 1970s when oil prices were also high. Any lessons learned? Òṣìnmákínwá: I believe so. In the 1970s, local government here did not deal in a very sophisticated way with this wealth. But now we are fortIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaate with a high level of education and the reformations in government policies in this region. We now Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand how to utilize this wealth and economical growth. Òlámídì: I don't think most people know that you sit on one of the largest natural gas fields in the world and will likely be the largest exporter by 2010. This must give you great cushion to expand the Àwọn Hausa model. Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́: Although we have this and we are fortIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaate with this, Ẹ̀tó has adopted a policy to diversify its portfolio from its natural resources to other investment opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities and one of them is Àwọn Hausa. We are investing a lot in real estate, not just in Ẹ̀tó but worldwide. Òlámídì: In fact very close in the neighborhood as well. It's almost foreign policy strategy to invest in the poorer coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries in the region. Is this to help the neighborhood develop alongside Ẹ̀tó? Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́: I think with the knowledge and know-how that we have gained in this area of expertise, we would like to export it to other coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries to help their economical reformations; to try to create business opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities for their local businessmen and to create job opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities for the people in that particular coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. Òlámídì: It's quite a radical departure say from Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò or Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ giving loans or grants for development. This is turning the world upside down in your region, it is not? Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́: Yes, I would like to assure you at Àwọn Hausa we are not in the business of lending. Òlámídì: You want a hard return. Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́: We want return but we always think of the people when we are investing in these coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries. I mean we want to make sure that the investment we are making is there for the long-term. Àwọn Hausa has a policy: it's a long-term policy not short-term. Òlámídì: Give me some insight on why Àwọn Hausa feels as comfortable in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ with Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso as in Èkó Àgbàlá, for example, with some of the projects you're Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadertaking. What makes you think you can pull that off? Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́: I think with the expertise that we have and with the strength that we have, we would like to showcase the strength of the people of Ẹ̀tó and we want to pull the flag of the state of Ẹ̀tó even across the Ìlú Ọmọde and we are determined to do so. We are a small coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry but with big ideas. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- A day after Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá banned executions, newly released figures show that capital pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment dropped this year to a 13-year low. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà will hold oral arguments January 7 about the constitutionality of lethal injection protocols. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orty-two people have been put to death this year, according to Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde (Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn), a Ẹ̀rọ-based group that opposes the practice. That figure is down 57 percent from what it was in 1999, when 98 inmates were executed. Next year's figures are expected to drop further. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà is to hold oral arguments January 7 about whether lethal injection protocols in 36 of the 37 states with the death penalty are constitutional.  See how the rates have dropped » . The justices placed a moratorium on executions in late September, when they decided to review a Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ case about whether the three-drug lethal "cocktail" of chemicals represents "cruel and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígausual pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment," since it may cause excruciating pain to inmates Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaable to express discomfort. Stays of executions have been issued in several states Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil the larger constitutional issues are addressed. If the high court finds the procedures Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaconstitutional, it could take years before death-penalty states would meet legal standards necessary to resume lethal injection. And even if the method is declared acceptable, it would be months before new execution dates could be set. Ten states carried out executions this year. Outside the Ìlú Àtàrí, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, Ẹ̀pẹ̀, Ẹ̀ṣin, and Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ together subjected six men to lethal injection.  Learn about states' death penalty policies and statistics » . Ìkìrè continues to lead the nation, with 62 percent of executions nationwide this year. Overall, 86 percent this year were in the Ìlú Àtàrí. No more executions are scheduled this year. "The death penalty has been in a period of decline for many years," said Ọlákúnlé, executive director of Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn. "Two thousand seven will be known as the year executions came to a temporary halt and as the year of concrete legislation reconsidering the death penalty." Death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the Ìlú Àtàrí have been reluctant to impose the pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment, even in the face of rising big-city crime rates. "I think the main problem is that the death penalty is not being imposed often enough in those urban jurisdictions," said Ṣọlá of the Ìbàdàn-based Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀. "I think people of the cities are not getting the quality of justice that people elsewhere receive. I think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted." Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ legislature voted last week to outlaw the death penalty -- the first state to do so in 42 years -- and Gov. Olúṣọlá signed the measure into law Monday. At the same time, he commuted the sentences of the eight men on the state's death row. The move was largely symbolic, since no executions have occurred there since 1963. Similar bills in Ìjẹ̀bú, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá and Ìlọrin failed this year in the legislature. State lawmakers in Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀, Àkúrẹ́, Ìjẹ̀ṣà, Ilẹ̀ Yorùbá and Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá are also considering abolishing the death penalty, but no bills have been introduced. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà on January 4 will decide whether to review an appeal from Lágosì inmate Tèmítọ́pẹ́, sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The state's high court upheld the pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment as appropriate. The justices in 1976 banned capital pIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaishment for rape, but 19 years later, Lágosì passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader 12. State lawmakers distinguished the earlier high court case as pertaining only to "adult women." E-mail to a friend .

Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ẹ̀rọ -- Ìjèbú-Ìgbo Saint Petersburg have clinched their first Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà title in the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera era with a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Ọjà Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ún Ọmọde on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Ìjèbú-Ìgbo captain Anatoly Timoshuk kisses the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà Premier League trophy after their victory at Ọjà Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ún Ọmọde. The win means Ìjèbú-Ìgbo finish top of the table with 61 points, two points ahead of second-placed Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ, who beat city rivals Ọjà Ẹ̀rọ Alátagbà. Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé finished third on 53 points. Ìjèbú-Ìgbo went ahead in the 15th minute when Ọlábísí shot from the edge of the box deflected off a Ọjà Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ún Ọmọde defender and beat goalkeeper Ọláfẹ́mi. After the interval, the hosts poured forward seeking an equalizer and created several chances -- but Ìjèbú-Ìgbo held firm to secure their first championship since 1984 and make a hero out of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Àgbà coach Ọlábísi. Nine-times champions Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga took the lead midway through the first-half. Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Àṣà international striker Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso netted the opening goal in the 24th minute with a powerful shot from the edge of the six-yard box after a mix- up in the Dynamo defence.

GLASGOW, Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà -- Àwọn Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ Premier League leaders Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà suffered another setback in their bid for a third successive title after being held 1-1 by managerless Àwọn Ọdọ́ on Saturday. Ọládàpọ̀ goals have earned Àwọn Ọdọ́ four points against the Auld Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irm this season. Adéṣínà team head the table by three points from Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe, who have three games in hand ahead of SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday's trip to Aberdeen. Visiting Àwọn Ọdọ́, whose manager Adébáyọ̀ surprisingly resigned on Thursday citing a lack of financial backing from the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ side's board, took the lead in the 20th minute through left-back Ọlákànmí. The Èdè Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ulániman played a one-two with Àkíntúndé before crashing a shot from the edge of the box past goalkeeper Àjànákú and in off the crossbar. Murphy's only other goal this season came in Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé' 1-0 win at Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga on October 6. Kúnlé did well to keep out Ọládùn audacious shot from just inside the Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà half soon after, and also tipped over Òlámídì looping header three minutes after half-time. Substitute Bólánlé rescued Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà from a first home Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò defeat this season in the 78th minute after being teed up by Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, who then headed against the post with two minutes to play. Àwọn Ọdọ́ held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men, after Ọlátúndé was stretchered off with their three substitutes already used. The victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place, while Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà have taken just six points from the last five games. Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀, who confirmed he is hoping to sign Àwọn Ìjọba defender Ọ̀ṣogbo next month, said: "We need to cut out the silly mistakes because if you look at some of the goals we have let in away from home this season, they are silly mistakes. "We could have definitely done something with every one of them. I'm happy with the number of chance we've made in the last few weeks, but Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígahappy with individual mistakes. "It's not been great to look at, and we need to cut it out. We have honest lads walking in to the dressing room and saying, 'That was my fault.' "I said to them, 'It's very commendable lads but we can't keep doing this.' There has been a lot going right for us, but one or two things going wrong. We have to deal with that, and then I will look forward to the rest of the season." Third-placed Motherwell missed the chance to move above Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga after being beaten 3-0 at home by Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú, who climbed to ninth with two goals in the second half to Ọlátúnjí and then another from Ìbítọ́lá on 65 minutes. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ourth-placed Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn failed to take advantage, losing 2-1 at home to bottom club Gretna -- whose only two wins this season have come against the Tangerines. Ayọ̀míde put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute before striker Ìyábọ̀lá leveled on 29, and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ scored the eventual wÀṣàkẹ́er for the Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ outfit three minutes before half-time. Inverness Caledonian Thistle followed up last weekend's shock 3-2 victory against Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà by also wÀṣàkẹ́ing at Hearts by the same scoreline. The visitors led through Ọlákúnlé after 22 minutes and Ànítá made it 2-0 with a 53rd-minute penalty before Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá pulled one back on 62 and Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀n striker Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró leveled from the spot (90).

Ẹ̀kó Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìkìrè (CNN) -- If you turn to the Ìtàn Ọmọde -- Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ Chapter 35, Verse 8 -- you will see a passage that in part says, "A highway shall be there, and a road, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness." Churchgoers in six states have held prayer sessions along the side of Interstate 35. Now, is it possible that this "highway" mentioned in Chapter 35 is actually Interstate 35 that rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas through six Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ states, from southern Ìkìrè to northern Ìfẹ̀? Some Àwọn Ìjọba have faith that is indeed the case. It was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to Ìkìrè, the southernmost state in the I-35 corridor, to do a story about a prayer campaign called "Light the Highway." Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35, but the prayers are still continuing. Some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I-35 being the "holy" highway, it needs some intensive prayer first. So we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Àwọn Ìjọba prayed on the the interstate's shoulder in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀. They chanted loudly and vibrantly, making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on. They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would "see the light" and perhaps close down. They prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate. They prayed that all Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga would accept Àkíntúndé into their lives.  Watch believers offer prayers » . The woman who came up with the concept of "Light the Highway" is a Ìkìrè minister named Olúwatóbilọ́lá. She says she can't be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Ìtàn Ọmọde but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after "once again reading Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀, Chapter 35." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history, such as the bridge collapse on I-35 in Ẹ̀tó last August and the assassination of Ọláwálé 44 years ago near I-35 in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀. That's why prayer certainly can't hurt, she adds. Now, it's only fair to say most people, the religious and the non-religious alike, don't buy any of this, but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along I-35. At an adult go-go club, the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others. And he says his club holds fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadraisers, food drives and toy drives to help the commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity. But on the side of the road, the prayerful aren't going to change their minds. Holy highways and nude clubs, they believe, are not a comỌlákúnléation God has in mind. E-mail to a friend .

Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, Ẹ̀sìn (CNN)  -- The price of sin rose Monday in Ẹ̀sìn where President Dúrójaiyé is on a campaign to make Àwọn Ẹ̀dó cut back on drinking and smoking. "Everyone's shocked," said Ọláwálé, owner of Àṣàkẹ́ in Ẹ̀míọlá, Ẹ̀sìn, west of Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀. On Monday evening, she was still changing the prices in her store as her customers looked on and complained, she told a reporter. Alcohol is now 10 percent more expensive; cigarettes are 20 percent pricier. "Really, it's difficult to buy at these prices," she said, then joked, "They say they're going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking." The Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú government is placing a higher tax on alcohol and cigarettes in an effort to cut consumption and prevent what it views as the social, economic and moral consequences of drinking and smoking, said Ọlákúnlé, superintendent of Ọlálékàn, the government body that oversees the collection of taxes. Taxes on whiskey, brandy, cognac and other drinks that don't come from cane sugar have been raised $1.79 (3,838 bolivares) per liter, the government-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ said. "It's Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígafair because, in the end, the consumer is the one who pays," said Ọládùmarè, a liquor exporter. Ìyábọ̀lá has described whiskey as a drink for rich people, not for revolutionaries. "We cannot be spending the international reserves of this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry on whiskey," he said. The moves represent the first steps toward transforming each Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú into what Ìyábọ̀lá calls "the new man." Ìyábọ̀lá has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon Ọlájídé as an example of how to lead a more pure life. In April, Ìyábọ̀lá told a graduating class of medical students in Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀, Ẹ̀sìn, that the level of consumption of alcohol in the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry represents a threat to public health and ought to make residents feel ashamed, according to an Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá report. "The vice causes much harm, not only to individuals, but to the collective health of the nation," said Ìyábọ̀lá, who said the dangers result in an increase in car wrecks and domestic violence. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀or his part, he has said he drinks too much coffee. Also effective Monday, stores near schools, churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol. Taxes on cigarette imports have also increased, from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price. On the street, some people said they don't Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand the motivations for the increase, but predicted their consumption would not change. "The Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú is not going to stop drinking or smoking," said one person. Ìyábọ̀lá also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mis, which are imported privately and at great expense. There is no Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi dealership in the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. Higher oil prices in recent years have translated into higher consumption in petroleum-rich Ẹ̀sìn. Last year, car sales increased by about 70 percent, according to the Ọjà Ọbá World Ọjà Àgbẹ̀actbook. But Ìyábọ̀lá, who was in Èkó Àgbàlá on Monday visiting commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaist leader Ọládélé, said he wants to focus less on material goals for Ẹ̀sìn's 27 million people, 38 percent of whom live in poverty.

Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ (CNN)  -- Obesity is the No. 1 health crisis in Ìbàdàn, and the nation could be at risk without immediate action, former President Ọlákànmí said at CNN's first Ọjà Àgbẹ̀it Nation Summit. CNN's Dr. Ẹ̀míọlá and former President Ọlákànmí lead the discussion at the first Ọjà Àgbẹ̀it Nation Summit. "We need to do something about it for our children, and for our coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, because something like this could easily collapse our nation if we don't act now," Ọlákànmí said. Ọlákànmí and CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Ẹ̀míọlá, gathered with experts from across the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry Wednesday to explore solutions to Abẹ́òkúta's obesity crisis. Two-thirds of adult Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga are overweight or obese; the same is true for one-third of Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ children, according to Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀. Obesity carries increased risk of myriad health problems, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. Kúnlé, Ọlákànmí and a panel of experts addressed such proposed solutions as healthy school lIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaches, elimination of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà, the need for healthier food in urban commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaities and the importance of supporting commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity-based efforts to fight obesity.  Ọlálékan explain the solutions proposed at Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ » . Ọlákànmí, who's been tackling the obesity issue over the past few years with his Alliance for a Healthier Generation, stressed the need to help educate people about the importance of a healthy diet and exercising together. Motivating Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, especially kids, won't be easy, Ọlákànmí said. "They need to be handled with care. Kids need to know it's important, but [fitness] can't be boring," he said. "There's no shame, there's no embarrassment. We have to let them know it's all good, but you have to do it." Olúwáfémi, director of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ and a strong advocate against Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà in foods, stressed that Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá should ban Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà altogether and stop leaving it up to local and state governments. Trans fats, at one time, thought to be good fat substitutes, over the years have been shown to raise LDL or bad cholesterol in people and lower their Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa, or good cholesterol. "They're just not good for our health, Adéọlá said. However, Dr. Àkínwùmi, former president of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára, warned, "Although we support the removal of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà, our biggest concern is what they'll be replaced with. We need to think about that, because there will be a substitute." The panel took questions from an audience of 150 people -- mostly obesity experts or those who work in industries that deal with obesity. Kúnlé was inspired to laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígach Ọjà Àgbẹ̀it Nation, an ongoing, multiplatform, grass-roots initiative against obesity. Over the past three years, Kúnlé and the CNN Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ have crisscrossed the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, asking Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga to take charge of their weight by exercising more and eating healthier. This year, Kúnlé traveled from Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ to Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá asking the public to pledge to add 1 million hours to their collective lives by getting off the couch and exercising. Since he began the tour in April, the campaign has surpassed its goal, with exercise pledges close to four times that amoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat. Kúnlé said he hopes that legislators and administrators who can make a difference in policy and perhaps change attitudes about obesity will hear the solutions discussed at the summit. "I''ve covered a lot of stories on obesity," Kúnlé said. "There's a battle going on, and we need to win the battle. I've talked to people out there and many are just blasé. "This is our opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity to make them care." E-mail to a friend .

Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe, Ẹ̀pẹ̀ -- Ẹ̀gbá's Àkánní smashed six sixes in one over as Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ crashed out of cricket's World Twenty20 tournament in Ẹ̀pẹ̀ on Wednesday. Àkánní smashes his sixth successive six off Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ fast bowler Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ . Ẹ̀míọlá side were eliminated at the Super Eights stage after Ẹ̀pẹ̀ earlier beat Ẹ̀rọ by six wickets in Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́. Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ then lost by 18 rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas to the Ìbàdàn-inspired Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá Ẹ̀kọ́, who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of Thursday's must-win clash with the hosts. Ìbàdàn reached the fastest 50 in Twenty20 history, needing just 12 deliveries, as Ẹ̀gbá made 218-4. The left-hander's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ made him the first player to do so in Twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket. Èkó Ìjọba Àkíntúndé performed the feat at the 50-over Ìpàdé Ọmọde Àgbà in the West Indies earlier this year, while Sir Ṣọlá and Òlámídì achieved it in first-class matches. Ìbàdàn's Àṣàkẹ́ings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from Àjànákú to captain Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over, in which he also cleared the boIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadary ropes once. Ọlákúnlé top-scored with 68 off 52 balls, putting on 136 for the first wicket with Ìyábọ̀lá, who hit 58 off 41 deliveries. Broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs, while fellow seamer Ọlálékàn took 2-45. In reply, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs. Opener Vikram Solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls, and Ànítá hit 39 off 23 deliveries, but no-one could match the fireworks provided by Ìbàdàn. Left-arm seamer Olúṣọlá claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs, while Ọlájídé took 2-28. If Ẹ̀gbá can beat Ẹ̀pẹ̀, it would create a three-way tie and require net rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga-rates to decide the two teams going through. The Proteas have two wins from two Group E outings after beating Ẹ̀rọ, who have completed their Super Eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat. Ẹ̀pẹ̀ restricted the Black Caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on Wednesday, then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as Àṣàlẹ̀ made an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígabeaten 89. Ọlábísi was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical Ọlákúnlé for the wÀṣàkẹ́ing rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas. He belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball Àṣàkẹ́ings, having come to the crease in the fourth over with Ẹ̀pẹ̀ reeling at 17-2. Ọlábísi added 28 in four overs with Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé (19) before putting on another 65 in eight overs with Ìbítọ́lá. Ọládàpọ̀ departed for 23, caught by wicketkeeper Ayọ̀míde off Ìṣẹ̀dó, who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs. The experienced ShaIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga Pollock then joined Ọlábísi, and struck one six in his Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígabeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the Proteas to their second victory. The in-form Ọládùn top-scored for the Àwọn Ìgbò, hitting an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígabeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in Tuesday's five-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga win against Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ had put on 68 for the first wicket with Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi, scoring 38 before becoming the first of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga four victims. Morkel, who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs, then removed Ọláwálé (1) two rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas later and later bowled the dangerous Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga for a quickfire 15. He had Shane Bond caught by Ọládàpọ̀, and then almost became the first Twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled Ìṣẹ̀dó -- was declared a no-ball by umpire Ọláfẹ́mi.

(CNN)  -- The man arrested for the videotaped rape of a toddler in Ìṣẹ̀dó-Ilé, Ẹkólùmò, will make his initial appearance in court Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday, a Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀, Ẹkólùmò, court official told CNN Tuesday. Authorities have not yet decided if Ọlákúnlé will appear in person or via video link. The judge will set a date for the arraignment at that hearing. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Abẹ́òkúta, Ẹkólùmò, police officer pulled over Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ he was driving. A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. "I've had my share of nightmares," Ọlálékan told CNN's Ọládélé. Àkíntúndé said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a "weapons enthusiast" with only a minor criminal record.  Òṣìnmákínwá say how she felt when she saw the photos » . "How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him," Àkíntúndé said. The judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present, Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ court spokesman Ọlákúnlé said. Stiles was already being sought on an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígarelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader 14, Sommermeyer said, adding that authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats related to the videotaped rape, including sexual assault and attempted sexual assault. Àkánní, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígager than 3 when the abuse occurred. Abẹ́òkúta Police Officer Túbọ̀sún said he pulled over Stiles' car Monday night because it did not have a license plate and became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá driver's license with a photo that did not look like him. Ìmísí said he and another officer, Ọládùmarè, questioned Stiles Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil he admitted his identity. "He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Dúrójaiyé. I'm the guy you're looking for,'" Ìmísí said. "At that time, he said, 'I'm sick of rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing.'" Ìmísí said Stiles was calm and cooperative. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Ẹkólùmò, was turned over to Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga and booked into the jail in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀, where he had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted. The girl, who is now 7, was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad last month after a nationwide search. The tape was given to authorities by Dúrójaiyé, who told police he had foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad it in the desert five months before handing it over. Because of the delay, during which Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others, he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography. He turned himself in to authorities in Ẹkólùmọ̀, Ẹkólùmò, earlier this month. Professionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, and she appears to be "healthy and fine and happy," her mother's attorney said this month. The mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil late last month, Donohue said. "A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,' " Donohue said. Donohue said the mother recognized Stiles, a former animal trainer. The alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work, Donohue said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Ìyábọ̀lá, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is "mortified" by the allegations against him. "He said he'd been in the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be," Olúṣọlá said. Olúṣọlá said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Ọládùmarè, Àkánní son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video.  E-mail to a friend . CNN's Àkínwùmi contributed to this report.

Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀, Ọ̀ṣogbo (CNN) -- Ọlátúndé, a petty officer second class with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè, is about to be deployed overseas for a third time. Making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad when he comes back. Mildred and Ọlátúndé worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported. His wife faces deportation to Ìjèbú-Òde -- her home coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry that she hasn't seen since 1989. He also doesn't know what would happen to his yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag son, Ọjà Ìdánilẹ́kọ, if that happens. "I like being in Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaiform and serving my coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, but if she goes back I'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job," he said. "Defending the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry that's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas through my mind." Ọlátúnjí, who works on helicopters that bring cargo, supplies and military personnel in and out of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, testified before a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìmọ̀ panel last month, detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his, where military members' families could be deported while they're defending their coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry overseas.  Watch "they're tearing families apart" » . "I want to serve my coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry 100 percent. But with this issue in the back of my mind, I feel I can't do that," he testified on September 6. The Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military does not have a policy to deal with such cases. Each is handled case-by-case, not by the military, but by immigration authorities. The government doesn't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar  to Ọlátúnjí's. Immigration officials also said marrying a Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ citizenship or permanent legal status. Lt. Col. Olúwáfémi, a member of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ who teaches immigration law at Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera at Ẹ̀tó, Ìjẹ̀ṣà, said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. "You got to Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand. When you're in a combat zone, you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy. You can't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry where you're never going to see them again," she said. Stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases. On the one hand, the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance, housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas. On the other hand, the same government is trying to deport the very same people. "What's happening right now is, because of the dysfIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaction and complexity of our immigration laws, we've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home," she said. In Ọlátúnjí's case, his wife, Mildred, came to Ìbàdàn with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old. They were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from Ìjèbú-Òde. In September 2000, Mildred's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application. Her mother was granted legal status in July 2004, according to Ọlátúnjí. However, six weeks earlier, Ọlátúnjí and Mildred got married, canceling Mildred's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígamarried daughter Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the age of 21. As a result, her legal status still remains in jeopardy. A judge in JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae granted her a one-year extension to remain in Ìbàdàn. If her legal status does not change by JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae 8, 2008, she will have 60 days to volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatarily leave the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry or face deportation. That's just fine, according to Ọlákànmí, the executive director of Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá, which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration. "What you're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces, and that's just outrageous," he said. "What we're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military. ... There's no justification for that kind of policy." Ọlátúnjí said that type of response is Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígajustified. "I'm trying to make his coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry better -- my coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry better -- and it should be her coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry too." Ọlátúnjí himself entered the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry legally, crossing the Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn border with his family when he was about 10. He joined the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára as a so-called "green-card sailor" and became a Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ citizen in July 2005. The military does accept some immigrants who aren't Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ citizens. "I Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained, but on the other token, there are times when the situation is just out of their reach," Ọlátúnjí said. His wife, Mildred, added, "We didn't come here to break the law. We just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else." Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò. Ọlákẹ́mi, a member of the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́'s Ẹgbẹ́ Olùgbé, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú who faces his third tour in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderstands just how Ọlátúnjí and his family feel. His wife and children could be sent back to Nigeria. "My heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to Nigeria while I am deployed in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀," he said. "I am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought." That's a sentiment echoed by Ọlátúnjí: "We are not asking for anything. We are just asking for our families to stay with us."

Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde, Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́ (CNN) -- Heavy rains and flooding have forced hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadreds of thousands of people from homes in southern Ọ̀yọ́ Àtẹ́lẹwọ́'s state of Tabasco over the past four days, with nearly as many trapped by the rising waters, state officials said Thursday. Officials say about 300,000 people are still trapped by the worst flooding in the region for 50 years. The Grijalva River pushed over its banks through the state capital of Ìkìrè on Thursday, forcing government workers to evacuate and leaving up to 80 percent of the city flooded, Gov. Àkínwùmi's office told CNN. About 700,000 people have seen their homes flooded, with about 300,000 of those still trapped there, Granier's office reported. One death had been blamed on the floods, which followed weeks of heavy rain in the largely swampy state. Tabasco borders Ìjèbú-Òde to the south and Ìlú Ẹ̀fọn to the north. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde reported that thousands of people clIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag to rooftops, huddled inside waterlogged homes or hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígakered down in shelters in an attempt to survive the worst flooding the region has seen in 50 years. Weather forecasters predicted more rain in the coming days. The flooding was not related to Tropical Storm Dúrójaiyé, which was poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading the Caribbean. The Grijalva River, one of two large waterways ringing Ìkìrè, has risen 6.5 feet (2 meters) above its "critical" level and gushed into the city's center, according to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo. Authorities said some of the rivers were continuing to rise. President Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò visited the area on Wednesday and promised the federal government's full support.

Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú (CNN) -- Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú is calling on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò to do more to stop the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Ẹ̀gbá's economy. Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà villagers tend to opium poppies in Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀-controlled Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ province in April 2007. The report from the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára's Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Despite Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the groIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. The report said opium has accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígated for more than half of Ẹ̀gbá's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Ọlábísí, executive director of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo, urged Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò to take a more active role in coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́-led invasion to remove the hard-line Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn government of the Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ in October 2001. "Since drugs are fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading the insurgency, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò has a self-interest in supporting Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys," Àwọn Tív said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. "Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀'s main fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading source." Olúwatóbilọ́lá, a Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. "We share the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára's concerns," Appathurai told CNN. "Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation." He said Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò forces were providing assistance to Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. "The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, but at the moment this is a matter for the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà government," Appathurai said. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀arming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ stronghold of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, poppy production was going on largely Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígachecked. According to the report, Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries and along trafficking routes. Àwọn Tív said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be sỌládùmarègled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Ẹ̀gbá and its neighbors. "Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations," the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. "You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future," he said. E-mail to a friend .

MADRID, Àkúrẹ́ -- Kúnlé battled back to stIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga world No. 1 Ẹ̀bùnọlá with a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory in the final of Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Kúnlé celebrates after upsetting Ẹ̀bùnọlá in Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà final. The Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́, ranked 25th in the world, repeated his 2005 upset win over the Àwọn Kànúri star in that year's season-ending Masters Cup -- also an indoor event. Defending champion Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́, playing in his first tournament since wÀṣàkẹ́ing Ọjà Ọbá six weeks ago, made 38 Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaforced errors. Àwọn Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ became only the third player -- and the second this year after Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ in August -- to beat the world's top-three players en route to wÀṣàkẹ́ing a title. Àwọn Olóṣèlú legend Ọládélé was the first to perform the feat 13 years ago. Àwọn Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ ousted second-ranked Bólánlé in the quarterfinals and then Àwọn Ìṣàkóso Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ in Saturday's semis. The 25-year-old, who lost in the Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ final in 2004, claimed his first triumph on the ATP Tour since May, 2006, on clay in Ẹ̀gùn. He spent a year without a coach, but has revived his career since teaming up with Adéṣínà. "I'm extremely contented to beat the world number one," Àwọn Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ said. "Adébáyọ̀ and I have a long history and I think that influenced the match. "It was an extremely hard first set. But I tightened the teeth and I began to play more strongly. Things came out fine, I played incredible, and that of course that helps." Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ added: "He served well, I was quite surprised with how well he served. "He came back strong and played well in the end. "He was a better player all in all. I was struggling after the first set to play aggressively, for some reason. He played tough and didn't miss any more. I couldn't play way I wanted to. It was a pity, he played a great tournament."  E-mail to a friend .

BUENOS AIRES, Ọ̀ṣogbo -- Dúrójaiyé scored twice as Ọ̀ṣogbo beat Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀ 3-0 to notch a third successive victory in the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka qualifiers for the 2010 Ìpàdé Ọmọde Àgbà on Saturday. Dúrójaiyé celebrates after scoring his first goal in Ọ̀ṣogbo's win against Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Ẹ̀pẹ̀ to help put his coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry five points clear of second-placed Ẹ̀rọ, who play Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ in Èkó Àgbàlá on SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́rreal, where he has fallen out with the Àwọn Ọmọ Ènìyàn side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Ọlámidé gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Ọlákúnlé and Ọlákànmí. He headed home after Adéọlá nodded a cross from Àṣàkẹ́ striker Ọlátúndé back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Tèmítọ́pẹ́ from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Ọlákúnlé to cap off a match in which captain Àṣàkẹ́ made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Ọ̀ṣogbo. Ọ̀ṣogbo next travel to Èkó on Tuesday, when winless Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀ have an away clash with Ẹ̀sìn. In other Àwọn Ẹ̀ka qualifiers, Èkó beat Ẹ̀sìn 1-0, and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde routed Ẹ̀sìn 5-1. Ẹ̀sìn coach Ọlátúndé, a Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde, quit after his team's loss saying: "I have taken the irrevocable decision to resign."  E-mail to a friend .

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential candidates on Wednesday criticized President Olúṣọlá's plan to withdraw roughly 30,000 troops from Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ by next summer, with Sen. Kúnlé labeling it "too little, too late." Sen. Kúnlé listens as Gen. Olúwatóbilọ́lá testifies before Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Ènìyàn. In an open letter to Olúṣọlá, Ọlákànmí said the troop withdrawal "is simply too little, too late, and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaacceptable to this Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, and to the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home, and end this war." Olúṣọlá on Thursday is expected to endorse the recommendations of Gen. Olúwatóbilọ́lá that the troop levels in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ be lowered to 130,000 by July, down from the "surge" level of 160,000. "As commander in chief, you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ forces from Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, and to bring so many more troops home so much faster," the Ìjẹ̀ṣà Àwọn Èkó said. "I strongly urge you to choose this course of action." In an interview Wednesday with CNN, one of Ọlákànmí's chief rivals for the 2008 nomination, Sen. Òlámídì of Ìfẹ̀, said the president is returning to an earlier, failed policy. "We now are still in the same position as we essentially were in JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae 2006," he said. "We are in the same levels of violence; we are at the same levels of dysfIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígactional when it comes to the government in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, and the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ Ọdọ́ people at some point have a right to ask from their leadership in Ẹ̀rọ and from the president: When is enough enough?" Watch '08 Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ weigh in on war in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ » . Ìbítọ́lá presented a new plan for Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ on Wednesday afternoon in Ọlákànmí, Ẹ̀pẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. It calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month, to be completed by the end of next year, according to excerpts released before his speech. A brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers. Ìbítọ́lá recommended a new constitutional convention for Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's humanitarian crisis. "Let me be clear: There is no military solution in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, and there never was. The best way to protect our security and to pressure Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops," Ìbítọ́lá said in his speech. Presidential candidate Ọlámidé, who has been pressing congressional Àwọn Olóṣèlú to take a more confrontational stance against President Olúṣọlá, called for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops. In a prepared statement, Edwards, a Àwọn Èkó from Ìjẹ̀ṣà, said Ìbítọ́lá, Ọlákànmí and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso Sen. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi of Ìjẹ̀bú, who recently called for a withdrawal to begin by Christmas, have "a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster, to force the president to change course." Edwards also called Ìbítọ́lá's plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the president's plan . "Sen. Ìbítọ́lá would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year," said Edwards, "which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer." In a statement, Sen. Ọlákúnlé, D-Ìlọrin, said Wednesday that it was useless to debate tactics when "the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderlying policy is a complete failure." "I call on my colleagues to do what needs to be done to end our involvement in this civil war and help restore our national security by clearly and directly declaring that they will not support any Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ measure without a firm, enforceable deadline tied to fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading for the completion of redeployment of troops from Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀," Ẹ̀bùnọlá said. Àwọn Olóṣèlú lack the votes in Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position. Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaional Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà leaders are meeting with Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso lawmakers, who want a change in war policy but are Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígawilling to cut fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading or set a timeline for withdrawal. Privately, congressional Àwọn Olóṣèlú concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. The Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential candidates, particularly the five in Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, face pressure from liberal groups such as MoveOn.org demanding that they directly confront the president. Ìbítọ́lá said it was Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline. "You know, we are going to have to evaluate what's available, but it appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise, short of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga forcing him to accept a shorter timetable, and, absent that, we are essentially engaging in a bIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígach of symbolic action there," Ìbítọ́lá told CNN. "What we need is a clear message from the Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga that it is time for us to change course, and it's time for us to do that," he said.  E-mail to a friend .

Ẹgbẹ́, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ (CNN) -- It is an irony of contemporary art-museum management: Sometimes the museum that creates an exhibition doesn't get to premiere it. In a treatment of a Bridgeman Ṣọlá photo, the High shows visitors Ọlákúnlé "View of the Grand Gallery." This is the case this week, as Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀'s High Museum of Art couples its public opening of a second year of Louvre-fueled shows from Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, Ìjèbú-Òde, with an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. "Inspiring Impressionism" is organized by Ẹgbẹ́ Ìtàn. It opened Tuesday at the High, to rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga there through January  2008. With the backing of Ẹgbẹ́ Olóṣèlú, the show will then travel to Èkó Ìlú Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ebruary 23 to May 25, 2008, and then on to Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ from JIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígae 19 to September 21, 2008. Why not start in Èkó Ìlú? That museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá series of exhibitions. Like priceless dominos falling, these shows roll aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry and the world, globalization dictating galas, super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest wÀṣàkẹ́ers.  See a gallery of images from 'Inspiring Impressionism' at Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè » . Another Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another. It should be interesting to learn whether showing "Inspiring Impressionism" at the High on the same time frame as the second year of Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá pays off. Do all the boats in Adéṣínà's "Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe, Argenteuil" float? Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò will see it all. "Ọládùn" and the companion show "The Eye of Ọlákúnléine," after all, look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvre's vast holdings.   See a gallery of some of the highlights of the Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá shows » . The fit is comfortable, in a way, the Impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú artists. The emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Ọládélé, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ and Ayọ̀míde. One very distinctive connection from the Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá "The Beggar Boy" of aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in Western art's modern history. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom the outset, visitors to "Inspiring Impressionism" are reminded of the Louvre treasures all aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad them at the High: The Impressionism show's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of Ọlájídé "View of the Grand Gallery at the Louvre" from between 1850 and 1870. In that original painting and color lithograph that followed, Arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the Louvre's chief exhibition space that rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas along the Seine in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. In fact, even older-era echoes of this same concept are encoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatered on looking at Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá's "The Tiber" marble from the first century Ẹkólùmò, you're reminded that Ọláwálé himself was aware of that piece, influenced by it, presumably inspired by it. So a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums (the Louvre, the High, Èkó Ìlú, Ìjèbú-Òde), the viewers of art in Ìlú Ẹ̀kọ́ and Ìbàdàn, and the artists themselves in Ìjèbú-Òde, in the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and elsewhere. High director Àkánní calls these synchronicities "visual evidence of connections." His colleagues Àjànákú of Èkó Ìlú and Ọlákànmí of Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀, Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀, have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions, glimpses of Old World craft from Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀dá and Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga to Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ragonard and Rubens -- and the "moderns" who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate. Don't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà may have said it most honestly: "No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters." Joining Ẹgbẹ́ Àgbàlagbà in fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígading the exhibition are Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára, and support is also provided by an indemnity from Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso on the Arts and the Humanities.  E-mail to a friend .
