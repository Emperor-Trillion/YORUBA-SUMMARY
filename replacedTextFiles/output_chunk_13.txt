(CNN) -- It's all tied up in Ìkìrè. Sens. Kúnlé and Òlámídì are rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing a tight race in Ìkìrè. A new Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà poll suggests the battle for the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential nomination between Sens. Kúnlé of Ìjẹ̀ṣà and Òlámídì of Ìfẹ̀ is a statistical dead heat in Ìkìrè, which holds primaries March 4. In the survey, out Monday, 50 percent of likely Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary voters support Ọlákànmí as their choice for the party's nominee, with 48 percent backing Ìbítọ́lá. But taking into accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 4½ percentage points for Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà respondents, the race is a virtual tie.  Watch Àwọn Olóṣèlú target Ìkìrè. » . Two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even. Map: National and state polling . "One reason the race appears to be tight is that Ìkìrè Àwọn Olóṣèlú are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options," says CNN polling director Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀. "Likely Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination, and they don't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues. "Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly, those people are splitting roughly equally between Ọlákànmí and Ìbítọ́lá." Many political strategists and analysts consider Ìkìrè and Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ -- which also holds a March 4 primary -- must-win states for Ọlákànmí. Ìbítọ́lá has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates, 193 of which are at stake in Ìkìrè. The new survey indicates Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ Sen. Ọlálékàn is the clear favorite for the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso presidential nomination. Among Àwọn Ẹ̀ka, 55 percent of likely Ìkìrè Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè primary voters support Àkíntúndé as their choice for nominee. Thirty-two percent back former Ẹ̀gbá Gov. Ànítá and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former Libertarian standard-bearer Olúwatóbilọ́lá. The poll's sampling error for Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso respondents is 4 percentage points. The Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà poll was conducted by telephone from Ọjà Àgbẹ̀riday through SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in Ìkìrè, including 553 likely Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso primary voters and 529 likely Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary voters. Àkíntúndé is the overwhelming front-rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganer in the fight for the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the candidate in an attempt for party Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity. The poll was released on the same day the only living former Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso president -- Ìbítọ́lá, the current president's father -- endorsed Àkíntúndé at an event in Ìjẹ̀bú-Ode.  Ìmísí get a big boost » . But Àkíntúndé has had trouble wÀṣàkẹ́ing conservative voters. Just last week, Àkíntúndé lost the conservative vote to Huckabee in the Ìjẹ̀bú primary, according to exit polls. The new survey, though, suggests Àkíntúndé may have better luck in Ìkìrè. "It looks like Àkíntúndé has made some inroads with conservative Àwọn Ẹ̀ka," Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀ said. "Àkíntúndé is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè primary. The Àkíntúndé campaign probably wishes that number were higher, but it does mean that a Àkíntúndé victory in Ìkìrè would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents, as has happened in several states in the past few weeks." Ìkìrè Àwọn Olóṣèlú and Àwọn Ẹ̀ka may not see eye to eye on the issues, but the poll suggests they do agree on what's the most important issue. Thirty-five percent of Àwọn Olóṣèlú and an equal number of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president. The second most important issue for Àwọn Olóṣèlú was health care, at 23 percent, followed by the war in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ at 22 percent, illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent. Nineteen percent of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka said illegal immigration was their most important issue, putting it in second place, followed by the war in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent. Sixty percent of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka say they'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing. That number climbs to 76 percent for Àwọn Olóṣèlú. Likely Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà primary voters view Ọlákànmí and Ìbítọ́lá on roughly equal terms. Seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if Ọlákànmí were the nominee; an equal number feel the same way about Ìbítọ́lá. Seventy-nine percent say it's likely Ọlákànmí can win the nomination; 82 percent say the same about Ìbítọ́lá. The two candidates are essentially tied on immigration, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ and the economy, but Ọlákànmí has an advantage on health care and abortion. E-mail to a friend .

(CNN) -- At least 200 people were evacuated from their homes, including 84 residents of an apartment building for the elderly, after a tanker truck carrying 9,000 gallons of gasoline erupted early Wednesday in a northern Ẹ̀tó suburb. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irefighters battle a blaze Wednesday north of Ẹ̀tó after a tanker overturned carrying 9,000 gallons of gas. No serious injuries were reported in the Tèmítọ́pẹ́, Ẹ̀gùn, blast, but witnesses recoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígated close calls to a local television station. One man said he narrowly escaped from his car before it exploded. "In consideration of everything that firefighters had to deal with, I think it's a miracle that we haven't seen some serious injuries," Ọlákẹ́mi Chief Ọládùn said. The tanker overturned and caught fire at a traffic circle in the town of about 37,000 outside Ẹ̀tó. Officials are investigating whether the driver was speeding, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde said. "Our major concerns right now are we still have an ongoing fire operation in the family dwellings, and we are still heavily engaged in those operations, and we have some concerns environmentally," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àwọn Ọmọde said.  Watch residents of an elderly housing complex describe their shock » . Ọjà Àgbẹ̀lames from the truck engulfed at least 40 cars and three buildings, two of them houses, fire officials said. The truck was destroyed, but the driver was not seriously injured, the officials said. WCVB-TV in Ẹ̀tó identified the driver as Olúwáfémi of Ìṣẹ̀dó, Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga. Seven hours after the truck caught fire, firefighters were still battling a blaze in one of the homes, according to the television station. Evacuees were taken to an armory converted into a shelter, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú official Ìjẹ̀ṣà told CNN. Local streets were closed temporarily, and a nearby school was shut down for the day, WCVB reported. One evacuee who fled a high-rise building told the television station he saw at least 15 cars burning. "And popping, they were popping. I don't know if it was tires that were blowing, but they were completely gone, the cars," Ayọ̀míde told WCVB. Nearby resident Ẹ̀míọlá awoke to the soIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad of a "big bang," he told WCVB. At first, he thought it was a car accident, but when he went outside to investigate the noise, he saw fire "just coming down the hill toward the houses as fast as you could think."

(CNN) -- Despite the obvious claims of yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígager rivals Òṣìnmákínwá and Ọlákànmí, few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted Ọlábísí dos Ọlálékàn as the 2007 World Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ootballer of the Year. Àwọn Ìjọba genius Ọlákúnlé fully deserves wÀṣàkẹ́ing the 2007 World Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ootballer of the Year award. The prestigious Ballon d'Or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and Ọlákúnlé's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old Àwọn Ìjọba's current standing in world football. When Ẹgbẹ́ Ògá defeated Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ in Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú final in Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀, avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in Ẹkólùmọ̀ two years previously, it enabled Ọlákúnlé to fulfill his dream of holding aloft Ìlú Ẹ̀kọ́'s premier trophy -- a wÀṣàkẹ́er's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance. Ọlákúnlé's stock for both club and coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry has risen steadily since his move to the San Siro from Ìfẹ̀ for a fee of just $8.5 million in the summer of 2003. Unlike many a Àwọn Ìjọba sporting genius, Ọlákúnlé did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town. He was born into a comfortable middle class Ìjèbú-Òde family, where football was not the only hope of a bright future. However, it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by Ìfẹ̀, after his family had moved there, at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old. Ọlákúnlé's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and Adéṣínà named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for Àjọyọ̀ Ọdún Kérèsì finals, earning him a wÀṣàkẹ́ers' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Ẹ̀pẹ̀. A year later, and Ọlákúnlé was on his way to Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. Within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the Ọlákúnlé lift the Ọlákúnlé and Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú. Throughout his career, Ọlákúnlé has always possessed the Àṣàkẹ́ate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry sees him average roughly a goal every three games. Yet to describe Ọlákúnlé merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice. Tall, elegant and blessed with astonishing skill, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ẹ̀rọ utilize Ọlákúnlé's ability superbly. Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ coach Ọládàpọ̀ soon recognized Ọlákúnlé's genius, changing his team's system to a 4-4-1-1, playing the Àwọn Ìjọba behind a main target man. With Ṣẹ́gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga and Ọlátúndé holding the central midfield area, Ọlákúnlé has a license to roam in behind the lone striker, be it Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ilippo Inzaghi, Bólánlé or Ọlámidé. And Ọlákúnlé does this with devastating effect, rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing at the opposition with pace and power, finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play. The fly in the ointment for Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ comes in the shape of their poor form this season. Although they have already reached the last 16 of Ẹgbẹ́ Òṣèlú, the club are floIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadering in Serie A and face the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígathinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season's competition Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaless they win the trophy. Real Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ have coveted Ọlákúnlé for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ don't secure a place among Ìlú Ẹ̀kọ́'s elite. E-mail to a friend .

Ìkìrè, Ìjèbú-Òde (CNN) -- Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà on Monday took the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaprecendented step of making a global appeal for help to identify a man from digitally reconstructed photos taken from the Internet that it said showed him sexually abusing Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaderage boys. This moving image shows how police used software to Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígascramble the image. (Source: Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà) The man's face was disguised by digital alteration, but the images were capable of being restored, according to a bulletin from Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà -- the international police agency based in Lyon, Ìjèbú-Òde. Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà Secretary General Ọládùmarè said the pictures have been on the the Internet for several years, but investigators have been Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaable to determine the man's identity or nationality. "We have tried all other means to identify and to bring him to justice, but we are now convinced that without the public's help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens," Noble said. He said there is "very good reason to believe that he travels the world in order to sexually abuse and exploit vulnerable children." Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà has determined the photos were taken in Ẹ̀tó and Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀. "The decision to make public this man's picture was not one which was taken lightly," said Ọláwálé, assistant director of Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà's Trafficking in Human Beings Unit.

Ẹ̀sìn Ìpínlẹ̀ (CNN) -- Up to 80,000 items at the Adéṣínàald Ànítá Presidential Library are Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ GígaaccoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígated for, probably because of haphazard record-keeping and inventory procedures, officials said Thursday. An audit foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad "significant breakdown in internal controls" at the Adéṣínàald Ànítá Presidential Library. An audit completed last month by Ẹgbẹ́ Ọmọ Oòduà inspector general looked at the management of presidential artifacts at six presidential libraries. It "cites particular issues at the Adéṣínàald Ànítá Library. ... We acknowledge that problems exist in inventory control at the Ànítá library," said a statement from Ọláfẹ́mi, national archivist. Inspector General Àkánní was more blIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat. A "significant breakdown in internal controls" was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad at the Ànítá library, in Ìlú Ọ̀yọ́, Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá, he said in a statement Thursday. The audit results prompted Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìjọba to urge Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀ -- which is responsible for maintaining the artifacts -- to move quickly to fix the problems. The chairman of the board of trustees has contacted Àjànákú "to express the serious concerns and disappointment on behalf of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìtàn àti Aṣa and Mrs. Ànítá," the foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadation said. Library officials told auditors that "the collection contained approximately 100,000 items, yet the library systems only had information to locate and accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat for approximately 20,000 items," Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára said. "This does not automatically mean the approximately 80,000 remaining items are missing. The vast majority may very well be safely located within the library's storage facilities. ... Some of these items may be missing or stolen, or none of these items may be missing or stolen." Control deficiencies at the library created an environment that could potentially have been exploited, Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára said. Although Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga has a copy of the audit, it has not yet been made public because of the ongoing investigation into the whereabouts of the items. The coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of 100,000 was an estimate taken from the original Ànítá Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣe database, Àjànákú said Thursday, but was never meant to be used as a concrete inventory control number. The Ànítá library has already begIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga implementing recommendations from the audit, he said. It has upgraded its management inventory software, is hiring additional trained museum staff, has begIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga a comprehensive inventory and is addressing storage issues by reshelving artifacts and taking steps to protect artifacts in case of an earthquake. "Like all of the presidential libraries, the Ànítá library stores their gifts in a locked vault, which is protected by a security camera," Àjànákú said. The audit examined management of artifacts at the Ànítá library; the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ library; the Tèmítọ́pẹ́ library; the Ọládélé library; the Àṣàkẹ́ library; and the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi library, Àjànákú said. "Early collections of artifacts came to presidential libraries with few controls and incomplete information relating to the collections," he said. E-mail to a friend .

The Ọlákúnlé fire, east of Camp Pendleton, caused the evacuation of the Ọjà Àgbẹ̀allbrook commIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity. Ọláwálé, assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense, said that 12 Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Ìbílẹ̀ firefighting teams, with 12 engines, are already working the blazes and more than 17,000 Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́smen are potentially available if needed. In addition, he said, 550 Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà from Camp Pendleton are preparing to deploy to the fire area. "All of the aid that we provide is the result of a request ... from the state," Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ said. "However, we have been very proactive in independently preparing those capabilities for the possibility of such requests, and we have reached out early to state officials." Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá Gov. Olúwáfémi has already called up 1,500 Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọdọ́ troops, including more than 200 taken from border duty to help with supplies and security at Ẹ̀gùn Qualcomm Stadium and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo, where thousands of evacuated residents are taking shelter.

Aerial attacks on the fires, however, have been minimal because of high Ẹ̀kó Ọjọ́pọ̀ winds with gusts approaching 70 mph. In an effort to make room for more civilians who have had to evacuate their homes, sailors stationed in Àgbàlá Ọ̀rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga are abandoning their barracks. "Orders have been given to all sailors ashore in barracks to move to shipboard billeting to provide room for evacuees," said a Tuesday statement released by the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ military. Only essential personnel are requested to report to duty at Naval Base Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀, Naval Amphibious Base in Coronado, and Naval Air Station in Ẹgbẹ́ Ìṣàkóso. Those bases have also set up cots and tents for evacuees. Also, the Ẹgbẹ́ Alágbára has offered an Aegis cruiser, a guided missile destroyer, and two fast frigates to support evacuation efforts.

Ọlákúnlé appears with his wife, Ọládùmarè, at a movie premiere earlier this month. "I think it's a privilege to call yourself a Scientologist, and it's something you have to earn," Cruise says at the begÀṣàkẹ́ing of the video. Cruise says he's "driven ... by the opportIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaity to really help, for the first time, change people's lives. I'm absolutely, Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacompromisingly dedicated to that." The video was shown at a 2004 Scientology ceremony honoring Cruise for his humanitarian work. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ilera officials said it can be viewed at any of its churches, but it created a stir this week when what the church calls a pirated and edited version appeared on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà.

The publisher denies leaking other parts of the video to the Web. In the video by the publisher, Cruise also salutes a portrait of Ọládùn, cited on the church's Web site as the foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader of "the only major religion foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded in the 20th century." Hubbard's biography cites his accomplishments as everything from mariner and horticulturalist to author and humanitarian. In the video, Cruise puts emphasis on the latter role. A Scientologist "has the ability to create new realities and improve conditions," Cruise says. On its Web site, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà highlights its humanitarian work, from anti-drug campaigns in places from Ìfẹ̀ to Ìlọrin Ẹ̀dá to teacher training in Ẹ̀gbá. The Web site defines Scientology as "the study of truth." Cruise embraces that in the video. "If you're a Scientologist, ... you see things the way they are," Cruise says. He also says he finds peace in the religion. "The more you know as a Scientologist, you don't become overwhelmed by it," according to Cruise. The Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaauthorized biography of Cruise is by author Ìyábọ̀lá. A Cruise spokesperson and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà have disputed the book, saying Ọlákẹ́mi did not seek their comment. "Túbọ̀sún and truth were not on Ọlákẹ́mi's agenda," according to a church statement. Ọlákẹ́mi denies that and says Cruise, who he calls "a towering figure on the international scene," and his faith are worthy of scrutiny. "Ọlákúnlé has done remarkable work for his faith over the past few years," Ọlákẹ́mi said. "If it wasn't for him Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo Àgbà would be a shadow of what it is today." E-mail to a friend .

Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà, Ẹ̀gbá (CNN) -- Ẹ̀pẹ̀'s new prime minister assured Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà President Ọládùn on Saturday that his coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's troops intend to be in Ẹ̀gbá "for the long haul." Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú President Àkánní, left, shakes hands with Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà President Ọládùn in Ìjẹ̀ṣà. Ọlátúndé and Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú President Àkánní flew into the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà capital, Ìjẹ̀ṣà, on Saturday to meet with Abẹ́òkúta and visit their respective coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's troops participating in the Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò-led International Security Assistance Ọjà Àgbẹ̀orce. In a morning meeting, Ọlákẹ́mi "assured President Abẹ́òkúta of his government's long term political and military support with the people of Ẹ̀gbá," according to a statement from the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà president's office. Rudd, who was elected in a landslide victory Nov. 24, appeared with Abẹ́òkúta at a news conference, where he repeatedly said that the Àwọn Ẹ̀gbẹ́ commitment to Ẹ̀gbá is strong. "We will be, as I said before, in this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, Ẹ̀gbá, for the long haul. It's important for us to be here in partnership with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries," Rudd said. "On the question of the broader security policy challenges faced within Ẹ̀gbá, of course they are significant, they are real. But we are confident that in partnership with our friends in the Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà government and with our other allies, particularly in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò, that we can continue to achieve real progress in the long-term security of this coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry," he added. Ẹ̀pẹ̀'s new defense minister, however, warned Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ and Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ìrìnàjò allies recently that they risk losing the war in Ẹ̀gbá without a sharp shift in military and reconstruction efforts there. Olúwatóbilọ́lá, who took office with Rudd allies during a conference in Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà earlier this month, said that more work needs to be done to win the "hearts and minds" of the people of Ẹ̀gbá in the 6-year-old war against the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's former Ẹgbẹ́ Àjọṣepọ̀ rulers and their Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá allies. Abẹ́òkúta wished those at the news conference a merry Christmas, then thanked Ẹ̀pẹ̀, Ìjèbú-Òde and other coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatries for their help and support.

(CNN) -- Ọláfẹ́mi turned himself in to authorities on Monday to get a head start on serving his sentence for rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing a dogfighting ring, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè said. Ọláfẹ́mi leaves court in Ọ̀ṣogbo, Ìjẹ̀bú, in August after pleading guilty to dogfighting charges. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Idánilẹ́kọ quarterback is scheduled to be sentenced on December 10 on a federal conspiracy charge of bankrolling the dogfighting operation.

The quarterback, who has been suspended indefinitely by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Olóṣèlú Commissioner Ọlákúnlé, faces 12 to 18 months in prison on the charge. Olúwáfémi pleaded guilty in August after three associates admitted their own roles in the operation and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom the begÀṣàkẹ́ing, Mr. Olúwáfémi has accepted responsibility for his actions and his self-surrender further demonstrates that acceptance,"  Olúwáfémi's attorney, Ọlájídé, said in a statement. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ wants to again apologize to everyone who has been hurt in this matter and he thanks all of the people who have offered him and his family prayers and support during this time," Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́'s statement said.

On September 25, a Ìjẹ̀bú grand jury indicted Olúwáfémi and the three co-defendants -- Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́, 35, of Ọ̀ṣogbo, Ìjẹ̀bú; Adéọlá, 28, of Abẹ́òkúta Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀; and Olúṣọlá, 34, of Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé, Ìjẹ̀bú -- on state charges of rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíganing a dogfighting ring at Olúwáfémi's home outside Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́. The Àkúrẹ́ grand jury brought two charges against the four men: one coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat of Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights. Each is a felony charge that could result in a five-year prison term. In addition, Ọlátúnjí faces three additional coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats of Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígalawful torture and killing of dogs. A hearing in that case is set for November 27, but Olúwáfémi does not have to be in court at that time.

Olúwáfémi tested positive for the drug on September 13, a court document from Ọ̀dọ̀-Òkè of Ìjẹ̀bú shows. As a result, Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ District Judge Òlámídì ordered Olúwáfémi to "submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance." Those methods could include random drug testing, a remote alcohol testing system "and/or any form of prohibited substance screening or testing," the order said. Olúwáfémi was also ordered to stay home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., "or as directed by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer," the order said. He was to be electronically monitored during that time.

(CNN) -- Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ootball should be used to teach yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag people moral lessons, Pope Àkíntúndé said during an audience with representatives from the Àwọn Ẹ̀dó football league and lower division clubs. Pope Àkíntúndé is presented with a football by Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà club officials. Àwọn Ẹ̀dó football has been tarnished in recent seasons by corruption, match-fixing scandals and crowd trouble, but the pope insisted the sport celebrated positive virtues as well. "The sport of football can be a vehicle of education for the values of honesty, Ẹgbẹ́ Àṣà and fraternity, especially for the yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígager generation," the pope said, according to Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀'s Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper. The comments are not the first foray by the Àwọn Èkó-born pope -- reputedly a Bayern MIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaich supporter -- into Àwọn Ẹ̀dó football. In October, he was presented with a No. 16 shirt by officials of the lower league club Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà after the Vatican endorsed its campaign to turn itself into a "beacon of morality" by adopting an "Àṣàkẹ́ovative, ethical model of practising football," Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Àgbà reported. The code committed Ẹ̀kó Igbómìnà to promoting fair play in a family atmosphere. The club is currently second in Ilé-iṣẹ́ Òṣèlú, Àwọn Ẹ̀dó football's third tier league. "Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ootball should increasingly become a tool for the teaching of life's ethical and spiritual values," the pope said. Pope Ọlákúnlé predecessor, Pope Ọlábísí, was also a keen football fan, reportedly playing in goal during his youth in Ìkìrè. All Àwọn Ẹ̀dó football matches were cancelled on the weekend following his death in 2005. E-mail to a friend .

Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ ÀgbàNGKOK, Ìjẹ̀ṣà (CNN) -- The wife of ousted Prime Minister Ẹkólùmò arrived in Ìjẹ̀ṣà Tuesday morning to face corruption charges, promising to fight the accusations, her attorney said. Ọlákànmí with her husband Ẹkólùmò. According to Pichit Chuenban, Ọlákànmí was presented with an arrest warrant shortly after arriving at Ọ̀ṣogbo's Suvarnabhumi International Airport and was escorted by authorities to Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá. "She intends to fight all charges through judicial system," Pichit said. Greeted by about 50 well-wishers, Àṣàkẹ́ arrived at court accompanied by her three children. She faces charges stemming from a Ọ̀ṣogbo land deal and a stock concealment plan that could put her in jail for up to eight years, according to Ẹgbẹ́ Ìrìnàjò. The court released her on 5 million baht (about $168,000) bail and ordered her not to leave the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. On Monday, Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's attorney Àṣàlẹ̀ said the former prime minister would return from exile in mid-April to answer to the same charges his wife faces. He was deposed by a military jIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígata in Sept. 2006 and fled to Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀. He plans to return after Ìjẹ̀ṣà's new government is in place. In December's parliamentary elections, supporters of Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àkànṣe, won nearly half the seats in the lower house and will lead the ruling coalition. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè leader Samak SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadaravej said a new parliament controlled by his party would pass an amnesty law to allow Ìjèbú-Ìgbo's return and amend the constitution to let Ìjèbú-Ìgbo get back into politics. Ìjèbú-Ìgbo said he would not re-enter politics when he returned to Ìjẹ̀ṣà.

Ìkìrè, Ìjèbú-Òde (CNN) -- The Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ suburbs were again rocked by riots after a second night of lawlessness Monday caused widespread destruction and left scores of police injured, according to Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú authorities and media reports. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀irefighters in a Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ suburb battle to control a blaze started after youths rioted SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday night. An angry mob repeatedly clashed with riot police and torched cars and buildings in the town of Villiers-le-Bel, north of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, after two teens on a motorcycle were killed following a collision with a police car SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday night. Rioters bombarded police with baseball bats, Molotov cocktail bombs and bottles filled with acid as the violence spread to the nearby towns of Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró and Grigby Monday night. The 15- and 16-year-old boys, both sons of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde immigrants, according to police, died when their motorbike hit a patrol car in Villiers-le-Bel. Some residents, populated largely by immigrants and their Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú-born children, accused police of fleeing the crash scene. However, three eyewitnesses, interviewed on TV, said the police stayed and tried to revive the two boys with mouth to mouth resuscitation.  Watch why a repeat of past rioting is feared » . More than 60 police officers were injured in Monday night's confrontation, with five kept in hospital in a serious condition, according to reports in a number of Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú newspapers. A spokesman for the police authorities in the Val d'Oise prefecture refused to confirm the numbers of police injuries, telling CNN that police feared the information could further enflame the already tense situation. The police spokesman said 60 cars, a library and car dealer's showroom had been set on fire in Villiers-le-Bel. He said a police station had also been damaged and 15 garbage cans torched. Security was tightened Tuesday, with helicopters deployed to patrol over the town, the spokesman said. Villiers-le-Bel was not among the districts hit by the weeks of nationwide rioting in November 2005, when disaffected youths nationwide set thousands of cars ablaze to protest against Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaemployment and discrimination. Those riots were also sparked by fatalities, namely the deaths of two men of Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ descent who were electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical substation. Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú president Àkánní, then serving as the interior minister, provoked controversy at the time by referring to the rioters as "scum." Ọlákẹ́mi, currently on a state visit to Ẹ̀ṣin Ìpínlẹ̀, had urged residents Monday to "cool down and let the justice system determine who is responsible for what." A spokesman for the president's office told CNN Tuesday they were continuing to monitor the situation. The prosecutor's office in the nearby town of Pontoise has already begIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga an inquiry into the deaths. Police said the teens drove through a red light without wearing helmets and on an Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaregistered bike. But Òṣìnmákínwá, the brother of one of the victims, told Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú media the police involved should be arrested. "Everyone knew the two boys here," he told Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú radio. "What happened, that's not violence, it's rage." According to the initial findings from the Àwọn Ẹ̀dá Olóṣèlú police watchdog, reported Tuesday in the daily newspaper, Le Ọjà Àgbẹ̀igaro, the boy's motorbike was driving "at very high speed" and had failed to give priority to the police patrol vehicle.

(CNN) -- The orgy of violence that has greeted Ìbàdàn's disputed election result has led to hIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadreds of deaths and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes. But away from the tragic human cost, the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígarest has also provoked concerns about the stability of the east Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's economy, Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatil now seen as a model for the region. Businesses have been destroyed and looted and supply routes disrupted after the opposition accused incumbent president Ṣọlá of election fraud after he was declared wÀṣàkẹ́er SIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaday. Investors are watching events closely in the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, fearful of how it could affect one of Ìlú Ọ̀ṣogbo's few economic success stories. And the early signs have been worrying. The equity market on Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àṣà Gbòòrò lost 40 billion Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú Shillings ($591 million) in value on its first day of Àjọyọ̀ Ẹ̀dá trading Wednesday, the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Olóṣèlú financial newspaper Ẹgbẹ́ Agbẹ̀ Yorùbá reported. And business leaders said that the government was losing aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 2 billion Shillings ($29.5 million) a day in lost revenue as a result of the political violence, the paper reported. "We do seem to be in a new place, there's a lot of Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacertainty about where we go from here. And a lot depends crucially on how long-lasting this is," said Ọládélé, an analyst specializing in Ìlú Ọ̀ṣogbo at Ilé-Èkọ́ Ifẹ̀ bank. Ìbàdàn has attracted a large number of multi-nationals and is home to one of the world's fastest growing stock exchanges. Its relative economic success has been helped in part by its thriving tourist sector, with visitors attracted by its abIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígadant wildlife and pristine beaches. Provisional figures for 2006 from the Ìbàdàn's tourist board said the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry had received 1.5 million visitors for the year, a growth of 5.2 per cent. However, fears that the tourist industry could take a heavy hit from the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígarest grew with Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdọ́ annoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacing Thursday it was suspending all holidays to the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry departing up to and including this Saturday.

Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Ìbílẹ̀ tourists already in the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry have been advised by Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ to stay indoors and to stay away from the major cities. There are also worries about the knock-on effect for the region, since aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 40 percent of Ìbàdàn's exports go to other Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde nations, Ọlábísi said. Of even greater concern is the effect on Ìbàdàn's lucrative agriculture industry. Exports of tea, coffee, vegetables and flowers are big earners for the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry, with agriculture making up about a fifth of the total economy. There have been media reports of tea and coffee auctions being halted by the violence as well as widespread disruption to transport routes as rioters blockade major roads across the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. Àkánní, who rIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas a coffee import business based in Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀, told CNN his livelihood depended on a stable Ìbàdàn. "We have had absolutely reliable supply," he said.

(CNN) -- The most compelling action during Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀'s primary Tuesday will be on the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso side. Ilé-Ìwòsàn Òkè Àró has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early, and top-tier Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà candidates have taken their names off the ballot, except for Sen. Kúnlé. The struggling auto industry has been a drag on Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀'s economy. In many ways, the Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso battle for Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ will be similar to last week's Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga contest. The primary is open, and any registered voter -- including independents and Àwọn Olóṣèlú -- can participate. Sen. Ọlálékàn won Ọ̀ṣIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga with the help of independent voters, and he is campaigning hard to re-create that success in Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀. In 2000, Àkíntúndé defeated then-Ìkìrè Gov. Dúrójaiyé in the Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ primary. In that vote, more than half -- 52 percent -- were either independents or Àwọn Olóṣèlú. Among Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso voters, Àkíntúndé lost to Olúṣọlá 29 percent to 66 percent. In that contest, almost three out of every 10 voters identified themselves as members of the religious right. Overall, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ is a swing state, producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders. However, voting trends favor the Àwọn Olóṣèlú. Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀'s governor, Ọlátúnjí, is a Àwọn Èkó, as are the state's two Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ senators -- Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ẹ́mi and Ọlákúnlé. The Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà presidential nominee has carried Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ in the last four elections. Sen. Ọlálékàn, the Àwọn Olóṣèlú' 2004 standard bearer, won Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀ 51 percent to 48 percent over President Olúṣọlá. The state's economy is powered by the automotive industry, which has experienced its fair share of struggles. Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀'s Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaemployment rate, 7.4 percent, is higher than the national average of 5 percent. Region by region . Ẹ̀ṣin, in the southeastern corner of the state, contains the economically depressed Ọ̀yọ́, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀'s largest city. Ọ̀yọ́ is predominantly black and solidly Àwọn Ẹ̀sìn Mẹ́sáyà. North of Ẹ̀ṣin are the more-affluent suburban coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaties of Ẹ̀rọ and Ṣọlá, which have grown in population in the last two decades.

The state's capital, Lansing, and the sparsely populated upper peninsula are also part of this region. The southwest part of the state is dominated by Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀, Ìkẹ̀tẹ̀'s second-largest city. Ìbàdàn Ìpínlẹ̀ is traditionally Àwọn Èdá and has many Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọdọ́ conservatives and generally votes Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ìṣàkóso.

"While Ilé-iṣẹ́ Orílẹ̀-èdè differs with Àkíntúndé on a number of issues, the Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ senator is a smarter, more tested and pragmatic leader who has shown since 2000 that he knows how to build bipartisan alliances aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad issues," the newspaper said in an editorial.

Investigators told Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá that a withdrawal from Lauterbach's bank accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat was made on December 14 and said there was "suspicious activity" on the accoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígat 10 days later. December 14 was also the last time Lauterbach's cell phone was used, authorities told Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá. Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀, citing Kúnlé, reported that the woman's mother said her daughter phoned home or her relatives up to 12 times a week and the mother became concerned when she did not hear from her daughter for five days.

Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ (CNN) -- The head of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s main humanitarian group said an 18-year-old approached him with a baby suffering from leukemia. The desperate mother said she'd do "anything" for treatment for her child -- and then offered herself up for sex. Baha, 12, waits for treatment in an Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde center after shrapnel pierced his left eye. Said Túbọ̀sún breaks down in tears as he recalls that story. Leukemia can be treatable to a degree in much of the world, but not in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. The baby died two months later. "It shook me like hell," said Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga, the president of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára. "All my life I've been a surgeon. I've seen blood; I've seen death. That never shook me -- none whatsoever. But when I see the suffering of those people, that really shook me." The plight of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s children is nearing epidemic proportions, he said, with mothers and fathers abandoning their children "because they're becoming a liability." The parents don't do it out of convenience, they do it out of desperation.  Watch the plight of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s children » . "When you become so desperate, you tend to just throw everything up and go," Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga said. "Every time I look at those children, I ask myself first, 'What crime have those children committed?'" Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga says Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde has the monumental task of treating and feeding more than 1.6 million children Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígader the age of 12 who have become homeless in their own coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry. That's roughly 70 percent of the estimated 2.3 million Àwọn Tív who are homeless inside Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. How to help Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára . With 95,000 volIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígateers and 5,000 employees, Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára is the last line of defense for the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry's poor, sick and displaced. They try to blend in as best they can, with Àwọn Ẹ̀ka, Àwọn Ìpínlẹ̀ and Àwọn Ọjà Àgbẹ̀ulani working in the neighborhoods distinct to their ethnicities. Six employees of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára have been killed over the last four years. Eight have been woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaded, including six left disabled by the severity of their woIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads. Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gíga says the spike in numbers of abandoned children is especially alarming, the result of sectarian violence and drastic socio-economic problems. The majority of parents in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀, he says, leave their children with a single relative who often has about 20 to 30 children to look after. Some parents just leave their kids altogether. Many of the families are living in areas without basic needs, like water and electricity, and there are no jobs available. "It's a desperate situation," he said. "Children are becoming a liability for both the father and the mother." The greatest concern is the ripple effect it will have in the long term -- an entire generation lacking basic life skills, surviving with no education, no income and no families.

"If somebody is injured by a bullet or shrapnel, it takes a week or two and he's fine. ... The psycho-social injury is pretty deep and can take months, if not years, to heal. "That's the task -- the mammoth task -- Ẹgbẹ́ Olùkọ́ is facing." The group gets some financial support from the central government. It's also negotiating with Ilé-iṣẹ́ Iṣowo, he said, to see if it can offer financial aid. But fIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads are low. Just recently, the group closed 18 camps for the winter and is trying to house those thousands of people in abandoned government buildings. At a waiting room at an Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde treatment center in Ọ̀yọ́ Ìpínlẹ̀'s Ọjà Àgbẹ̀únmiláyọ̀ district, CNN came across several yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígag children in desperate need of care. But they were among the lucky ones -- if that term can even be applied -- because their parents remain with them. Baha, a 12-year-old boy, was waiting to see a doctor, recalling the exact date -- January 16, 2004 -- he lost his left eye. "I want my eye to get well," he said. Baha was with his father in a market when someone opened fire on Ìfẹ̀ Ìpínlẹ̀ soldiers. When the soldiers fired back, shrapnel hit his eye. Despite what happened, this brave boy still goes to that same market. "I'm not afraid," he said. Across the room, 3-year-old Saja lightened the mood in the room. "Àwọn Tív, we are still brothers!" she sang. She giggled, laughed and darted aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad, bringing smiles to all who saw her. Yet, she couldn't see most of what was aroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad her. She's blind in one eye and losing sight in the other -- the result of shoddy medical care. Her father, Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá, said he heard about Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára from television and others who had been treated here. He said he can't afford to travel outside the coIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígatry for medical treatment for his girl. This clinic, he said, has given him "a ray of hope that I had lost." He, too, expressed despair over the plight of Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀'s yoIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígagest generation. "Our children are suffering. All they talk about is weapons and bombs," he said. "They are children. We are older; our hair turns gray. What happens to them hearing all the explosions and bombs? "We can't make them feel better because we are down." That's a sentiment that haIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígats the head of Ilé-iṣẹ́ Ẹ̀rọ Ayélujára. "There are times I get up in the middle of the night and I say, 'Oh my God, how are we going to solve it?

Ìjèbú-Ìgbo, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ (CNN)  -- Coalition forces foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad 26 bodies buried in mass graves and a bloodstained "torture complex," with chains hanging from walls and ceilings and a bed connected to an electrical system, the military said Wednesday. Twenty-six bodies were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad in mass graves near a "torture complex" discovered by coalition forces. The troops made the discovery while conducting an operation north of Muqdadiya, Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀. Ọjà Àgbẹ̀rom December 8 to 11, the troops who foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad the complex also killed 24 people they said were terrorists and detained 37 suspects, according to a statement issued by Ẹgbẹ́ Aládàáṣiṣẹ́ in Ìlọrin Ìpínlẹ̀. The moves were part of an operation called Iron Reaper that has been in progress across northern Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ for the past few weeks. The complex was in an area thought to be an Ilé-iṣẹ́ Àdánidá in Ẹ̀kó Ìbílẹ̀ haven and operating base, the military said. Àwọn Tív had told the military about the site during an earlier operation. "Evidence of murder, torture and intimidation against local villagers was foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad throughout the area," the military statement said. GroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad forces first foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad what appeared to be a detention facility, which was one of three connected to the torture complex, Ẹgbẹ́ Ẹ̀dá Ayé said. One of the facilities appeared to have been a headquarters building and a torture facility, it added. As the area was cleared, the bodies were foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad. Eventually, 26 bodies were Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacovered in mass graves next to what were thought to be execution sites, the military said. The bodies are believed to have been dead between six and eight months, according to a gruesome military video shot at the scene. Some had their hands tied behind their backs. Identification is proving to be a challenge because of advanced decomposition. Photos given to the news media show a filthy bed wired to an electrical system, with an outlet hanging from wires on the wall. In the video, troops point out rubber hoses and boxing gloves, a ski mask and a blood-covered sword and knives. Other still photos show an entrance to the Ilé-Ẹ̀kọ́ GígadergroIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad bIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígaker and barbed wire stretched outside it. A short distance away from the complex, troops foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad a bullet-riddled Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde police vehicle. Some of the bodies may belong to Àwọn Ẹ̀ka Ẹ̀kọ́ Ọmọde police, according to the military video. The operation netted nine weapons caches, which have been destroyed, the military said. They included anti-aircraft weapons, sniper rifles, more than 65 machine gIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígas and pistols, 50 grenades and a surface-to-air missile laIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígacher and platform, the statement said. Also foIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígad were mines, pipe bombs, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar tubes and roIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads and 130 poIlé-Ẹ̀kọ́ Gígads of homemade explosives. E-mail to a friend .
